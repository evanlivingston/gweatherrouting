# Development version and upstream contributions

`dev` is this fork's complete working version. It preserves the history of
`charts/fluid-map-and-downloads`, including the macOS setup, detailed charts,
smooth navigation, wind rendering, playback fixes, and subsequent validation
fixes. Linux and macOS CI run when `dev` is pushed.

The legacy chart branch is retained for history. Its fork PR is superseded by
the focused upstream contributions below; it is not the integration branch.

| Contribution | Branch | Upstream PR | Independent local validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS setup and GTK threading fixes | `macos-dev-setup` | [#267](https://github.com/dakk/gweatherrouting/pull/267) | Existing contribution; retained in `dev` |
| Smooth zoom, pan inertia, Display preferences | `upstream/smooth-navigation` | [#268](https://github.com/dakk/gweatherrouting/pull/268) | 328 tests, 38 subtests; Black, Flake8, mypy |
| NOAA discovery/downloads, ENC portrayal, Canadian CHS imagery | `upstream/downloadable-charts` | [#269](https://github.com/dakk/gweatherrouting/pull/269) | 375 tests, 38 subtests; Black, Flake8, mypy |
| Background wind rendering, cursor queries, forecast playback | `upstream/wind-display-performance` | [#270](https://github.com/dakk/gweatherrouting/pull/270) | 347 tests, 38 subtests; Black, Flake8, mypy |

The three new contributions were independently prepared from parent `master`
at `946e66c`. Each includes the support it needs, so none requires another
pending PR or the macOS setup to merge first. Frozen map viewports, windowless
test fixtures, and the GTK test environment have identical support patches
across these branches. The chart and wind branches also share an identical
generic overlay worker. Once shared support lands, synchronize the remaining
branches with parent `master` so their diffs show only the remaining changes.
Resolve any overlapping settings or chart-stack integration changes and rerun
the relevant checks; do not assume every merge order is conflict-free.

The complete `dev` version passes 414 tests and 38 subtests, plus Black, Flake8,
and mypy. Native playback with a real GRIB and forced rendering delays verified
that forecast transitions do not show blank wind frames. These are local
validation results; upstream CI and review are tracked on the PRs.

New work starts on `feature/<topic>` from `dev`. Apply upstream review fixes on
the relevant contribution branch, validate that branch, and bring the fixes
back into `dev`. Keep `AGENTS.md`, this tracking file, and fork-only CI triggers
out of upstream PRs. Preserve `master` as the parent-tracking branch.

## NMEA 2000 reception and recording

- Status: candidate for upstream; integrated locally on `dev` from
  `feature/nmea2000-actisense`.
- Functional commit: `19128ad` (`Add multi-format NMEA 2000 recording`).
- Scope: transport-independent PGN messages and instrument conversions;
  Actisense BST and N2K ASCII over serial/TCP/UDP; raw CANboat-format session
  archives; and a pseudo-terminal simulator. SocketCAN and Yacht Devices RAW
  remain future adapters.
- Validation: 60 focused NMEA 2000 tests pass, including serial/network input,
  plus a GTK settings smoke test. Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks
  pass. The full suite was attempted but the sandbox aborted while importing
  native GDK in chart tests; no assertion failure was reported. Onboard NGT-1
  compatibility and Polarize import have not been verified.
- Intended upstream scope: separate reusable receiver/conversion work from
  fork-specific recording and simulator features. No upstream PR is open.

## Fork review before upstream submission

New work is reviewed through regular PRs in this fork first. Independent PRs
start from `dev`; dependent PRs can target their prerequisite feature branch so
the review shows only the additional work. Nothing is merged or submitted to
upstream until the user approves that action. After approval, extract focused
changes onto fresh `upstream/<topic>` branches and validate them independently.

Current review order:

1. `feature/latest-wind` → `dev`: newest enabled wind model run, fallback to
   older coverage, duplicate-free weather grids, and gradient seam fixes.
2. `feature/tides-currents-plan` → `feature/latest-wind`: marine data providers,
   tide caching, current-aware routing, coverage recovery/prefetch, batched
   calculation, and Currents/Tides controls. Retarget this PR to `dev` after
   the wind PR merges and verify the diff again.

The full marine feature is a fork integration review, not one proposed upstream
patch. Its data/provider layer, UI, current-aware routing, geometry/performance
work, and forecast recovery may need separate upstream contributions. The
newest-run wind policy relates to upstream issue #185; marine routing relates to
#158 but does not implement arbitrary current GRIB imports. Existing upstream
PRs #267–#270 are unchanged by these fork reviews.

## Contribution queue

This queue records review and extraction boundaries. Local development continues
while an item waits for human review, a dependency, or upstream feedback.
"Candidate" means a possible future submission, not authorization to publish it.
Keep validation tied to the tested snapshot; rerun relevant checks after review
fixes, retargeting, or adapting code to upstream.

| Contribution | Fork review | Functional commits | Local validation | Upstream disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latest wind selection and gradient fixes | [#2](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/2), targets `dev` | `5646ea4` | 420 tests, 38 subtests; Black and Flake8 pass | Candidate: focused adaptation for issue #185; coordinate display changes with existing upstream PR #270 |
| Tides and current-aware routing | [#3](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/3), targets `feature/latest-wind` | `0dc8392`, icon follow-up `9b97439`; depends on `5646ea4` | 624 tests, 54 subtests; Black and Flake8 pass; wheel build passes. Icon follow-up: 23 GTK tests pass; Black/Flake8 pass; native preview verifies both top buttons, light/dark rendering, accessibility and floating/redocking. | Candidates: separate data/provider, UI (including the shared tides/current icon), routing, recovery and performance contributions; assess prerequisites before submission; related to #158 |
| Local profiling records | Included in fork #3 | `f662d8f` | Historical measurements and reproduction notes | Fork-only artifacts; extract portable benchmark tools separately if useful |
| Fork workflow and PR template | Included in fork #3 | Separate policy commits | Documentation and diff checks | Fork-only; exclude from parent-project PRs |

Both code snapshots reproduce the same 31 repository-wide mypy errors in six
unchanged files as baseline `dev` in the current native environment, with no new
errors. Earlier validation results above used a different dependency environment;
they are historical records rather than evidence that the current full type
check passes.

After fork #2 merges with user approval, retarget #3 to `dev`, verify that its
diff contains only the remaining work, and rerun relevant checks before merging.
Upstream submission requires separate authorization. Neither fork PR has been
merged as part of establishing this workflow.

## Measured performance on polar charts

- Status: candidate; local work on `feature/polar-performance` from `dev`.
  Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: full-circle Polars comparison with instrument scatter points colored
  by nearest predicted wind-speed band; separate STW/SOG histories; live
  collection with freshness/validity checks; interpreted NMEA log import;
  wind-band filtering, instant curve/sample hover inspection with curve dimming,
  corrected boat-speed rings, and a dockable/floating NMEA performance panel.
- Dependencies: existing NMEA packet delivery. NMEA 2000 support uses the
  existing interpreted conversions; basic NMEA 0183 operation is independent
  of that contribution. Raw PGN import and automatic apparent-to-true wind
  derivation are outside this change.
- Validation: 129 focused tests pass (performance collection and GTK controls,
  boat information, polar wrapper, data sources, connection management, and
  tool docking). Sidebar sizing and hide/float/redock behavior preserve samples
  and collection settings. Floating palettes use rounded client-side decorations
  without the outer white outline; native window exterior verified on macOS.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass. Native GTK preview verified
  the complete Polars tab with 2,200 synthetic observations. No onboard data
  validation or full-suite run performed for this change.
- Intended upstream scope: reusable sample collection, polar visualization,
  controls, deferred initial dock sizing, tests, and user documentation; exclude
  this fork tracking entry.

## Polar Manager component migration

- Status: candidate; local dependent work on `feature/polar-performance`,
  using its Polars tool dock. Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: reusable Polar Manager panel with Local polars and ORC catalog tabs;
  docked/floating integration in Polars and the routing wizard; persistent
  search/selection across hide/show; asynchronous downloads with lifecycle
  guards; immediate list updates and model-based toggles after sorting.
- Validation: 40 focused tests pass across Polar Manager, performance controls,
  tool docking, and current-routing/wizard integration. Imports, removal,
  enable/disable, download completion, destroyed-panel callbacks, and reuse
  are tested with file dialogs and network workers mocked. Native dark-theme
  previews verified docked Local polars and floating ORC catalog layouts.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass. Live ORC service access was
  not exercised for this migration.
- Intended upstream scope: reusable panel and component integration, the
  shared fix selecting newly opened component tabs, tests, and documentation.
  Keep this fork tracking entry out of an upstream contribution.

## Polar selector component

- Status: candidate; dependent local work on `feature/polar-performance`.
  Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: move the existing filename/sail/name/type selector into a reusable
  dockable/floating component, with a toolbar visibility toggle. Preserve
  selection by filename across list refreshes; retain the speed table in the
  main view and keep chart/table updates connected to selection changes.
- Validation: 41 focused GTK and routing tests pass, including sorted selection,
  float/hide/redock, refresh while hidden, and fallback after polar removal.
  Native dark-theme previews verified sidebar and floating selector layouts.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass.
- Intended upstream scope: selector extraction, toolbar integration, selection
  preservation, lifecycle cleanup, tests, and documentation; exclude this entry.

## Vertically stacked component groups

- Status: candidate; local dependent work on `feature/polar-performance`.
  Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: shared component bar supports resizable vertical groups alongside
  tabs and floating windows. Named tabs move individual components; dotted
  grips move entire groups. Upper/lower drops split vertically with blue
  insertion feedback; middle/tab-strip drops group or reorder tabs. Hidden
  components retain their group and state.
  Polars and Charts keep their tab toolbars above the main content and
  component bar, below the application's horizontal toolbar; status bars
  also span the tab width.
- Pointer fix: the initial implementation reparented docked groups on the
  first mouse motion, unmapping the grip and losing its release event on
  macOS. Tabs and grips now use explicit GTK pointer handling, retain the
  mapped event source until release, and only then transfer components.
  Drop feedback changes only when the destination changes, avoiding repeated
  layout changes during motion. GTK's platform drag-and-drop transport is
  no longer required for component placement.
- Validation: 60 focused tests pass across dock lifecycle, Polars controls,
  manager/selector integration, routing wizard, and Currents/Tides panels.
  Regression tests send GTK press/motion/release events without mocking drag
  transport and assert that the source stays mapped and its grab is released.
  Seven native macOS mouse-event gestures independently verify below/above
  stacking, tab merging, floating a tab, and grip docking/floating/merging.
  Native rendering verifies two live Polars components in a vertical stack.
  Full-app rendering verifies both tab toolbars above their sidebars, with
  a geometry regression assertion for the Polars toolbar and sidebar.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass.
- Intended upstream scope: shared dock stacking and pointer fix, tests, and
  usage documentation; exclude this entry and unrelated Polars feature work.

## Shared NMEA streaming and log playback component

- Status: candidate; local dependent work on `feature/polar-performance`,
  building on its performance controls and shared tool dock.
  Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: one Core-owned NMEA session, with dockable/floating NMEA views in
  Charts, Logs, and Polars. Share live/log selection, stream pause, loaded
  file, playback position, play/pause/restart, and speed across tabs. Keep
  polar display filters in a separate Performance component. Load logs in
  the background, provide a full analysis overview, and replay through the
  same selected stream used by instruments, maps, and measured polars.
- Input policy: live input is excluded while replay is selected; pausing input
  or changing away from live stops active recording. NMEA UTC timestamps set
  playback timing, including midnight rollover; untimestamped logs explicitly
  use ten sentences per second. Maximum file size is one million valid
  sentences. Polar sample pairing retains the existing five-second live and
  fifty-line imported freshness policies, with no new wind approximation.
- Logs: consume the selected stream without a separate polling thread, discard
  queued packets after a source reset, and throttle plot refreshes. Preserve
  recording and raw PGN archives; save cropped loaded logs without modifying
  their source. Normalize UTC crop bounds and plot short logs without dropping
  nearly all their points. Automatic loading of the previous temporary
  recording at startup is replaced by explicit shared source selection.
- Validation: 183 focused tests and 8 subtests pass across shared session/views,
  performance, docking, Polar Manager, current-routing integration, NMEA 2000
  conversion/recording, and AIS. Coverage includes pause/resume/end/restart,
  speed, midnight rollover, dense replay batches, malformed/failed/stale loads,
  preservation across tab/hide/float/recreation, load completion after view
  destruction, stale queued packets, and cropped saves with raw companions.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass. Native full-app rendering
  and assertions exercise all three tabs, overview, replay, source reset, and
  synchronized controls with network polling and settings writes disabled.
  Live hardware streaming was not exercised.
- Intended upstream scope: reusable session and controls, tab integration,
  necessary Logs lifecycle/save fixes, regression tests, and documentation.
  Queue extraction until the performance/tool-dock prerequisites are reviewed;
  exclude this fork tracking entry and unrelated manager or routing changes.

## Sidebar persistence across workspace tabs

- Status: candidate; dependent local work on `feature/polar-performance`,
  following the shared tool dock and NMEA component. Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: Charts, Logs, and Polars use a single workspace dock and one NMEA
  widget. The same sidebar follows the active tab below its toolbar, retaining
  open/hidden components, selected component tabs, vertical groups, sidebar
  width, divider positions, and floating windows. Components opened from any
  tab stay available on the other tabs, and NMEA toolbar toggles stay synchronized.
  Tab-specific content stays alive in the shared dock's content stack.
- Layout: preserve vertical divider positions when toolbar heights differ and
  avoid revealing intentionally hidden view controls during remounting. Retain
  standalone tab construction for embedding and focused tests.
- Validation: 72 focused GTK, NMEA session/performance, manager, and routing
  tests plus 8 subtests pass. Regression checks use different tab toolbar heights
  and verify the same mapped sidebar, selected tabs, split widgets/positions,
  width, floating placement, hidden components, and singleton NMEA widget.
  Native pointer tests now wait for frame-clock allocations before using geometry,
  fixing intermittent failures caused by reading layout before its next frame.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass. Full-app preview checks
  all three tabs, toolbar/sidebar ordering, split sizes, hidden routing controls,
  floating windows, and synchronized toolbar toggles with polling and settings
  writes disabled.
- Intended upstream scope: workspace dock, tab integration, singleton component
  attachment, geometry/lifecycle regression tests, and usage documentation.
  Queue on the shared tool-dock and NMEA prerequisites; exclude this tracking entry.

## Recorded-track rendering during chart motion

- Status: candidate; local follow-up on `feature/polar-performance`, after the
  shared NMEA/sidebar work. Functional commit: `a498dc7`. No review PR yet. The rendering change
  itself does not require the sidebar or NMEA component for upstream extraction.
- Problem: drawing a long recorded boat track projected every point separately
  and reapplied its style for every segment on every pan/zoom frame, including
  entirely offscreen geometry. Route times were also reparsed for every segment
  on each frame.
- Scope: use the existing batch Mercator projection for the recorded track;
  reject only segments whose bounds lie wholly beyond a viewport edge, with
  padding for strokes; retain separate strokes and every original track point.
  Cache route datetime parsing in a bounded cache while converting timestamps
  during drawing, preserving legacy local-time and explicit-offset behavior.
  Rebuild track arrays from current points each frame, so live appends, edits,
  clear, and source replacement need no cache invalidation policy.
- Fidelity: no track simplification, dropped source points, source-selection
  changes, or new route approximation. Crossing segments remain visible when
  both endpoints are outside the viewport. Separate strokes preserve alpha
  overlaps, caps, and dash behavior.
- Validation: 43 focused geometry/rendering, map-motion, and shared-sidebar
  tests plus 9 subtests pass. Tests cover visible raster equivalence at fractional
  zooms and both pixel densities, offscreen/crossing segments, live mutations,
  route timestamp reuse, mixed local/UTC times, and daylight-saving transitions.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass.
- Measurements: a pinned 26,570-point recorded track with existing routes,
  634×750 logical pixels at 2× density, 15 measured draws after warmup,
  without profiler overhead: visible-track median 60.1→7.4 ms at zoom 14 and
  60.9→8.6 ms at zoom 13.6; offscreen-track median 56.3→2.6 ms. Pixel buffers
  are byte-identical in all three comparisons. A full-app motion run with
  cProfile enabled reduced average total map draw time from about 216 ms to
  16 ms. With pinned identical data, the previous per-tab dock and the shared
  sidebar had the same original bottleneck. Local profiling scripts, snapshots,
  and results remain in `/private/tmp` and are excluded from contributions.
- Intended upstream scope: geometry rendering, bounded timestamp parsing,
  regression tests; exclude fork tracking and unrelated UI changes.

## Workspace preferences between launches

- Status: candidate; dependent local work on `feature/polar-performance`,
  following the shared NMEA session, workspace dock, and Polar Manager panels.
  Functional commit: `55481bf`. No review PR yet.
- Scope: restore active tab, map centers and zoom, window geometry/maximization,
  sidebar visibility, groups, selected tabs, dividers and floating windows,
  chart/log display toggles, selected polar and performance filters, manager
  search/tab, and live input/playback speed preferences. Restore before showing
  the main window and fit floating windows to available monitor workareas.
- Storage: versioned `workspace.json`, atomic replacement, debounced saves after
  interaction settles, and a final save on exit. Pan/zoom frames perform no disk
  writes. Missing, corrupt, unsupported, or unavailable files are nonfatal.
  Samples, loaded-log contents/path, replay position, and recording are session
  state and are excluded. Startup uses live input with the saved stream preference.
  Account for the native divider width to prevent sidebar drift across launches.
- Validation: 85 focused tests plus 14 subtests pass across persistence, native
  workspace restoration, docking, NMEA controls, polar panels, map rendering,
  and routing integration. Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, and diff checks pass.
  Separate native setup/relaunch processes restored maps, grouped/split/floating
  panels, filters, paused live input, and exact sidebar width from a 1,972-byte
  file, with network polling and user settings writes disabled. No live hardware
  or full-suite validation performed.
- Intended upstream scope: preference store, restore/save lifecycle, component
  serialization and stable widget IDs, regression tests, and documentation.
  Queue extraction on the shared dock/NMEA prerequisites; exclude this tracking
  entry and unrelated rendering work.

Final combined pre-commit validation: 103 focused tests and 17 subtests pass,
including NMEA session timing and measured polar collection in addition to the
workspace/UI/rendering checks above. The integrated component changes share
initialization and dock lifecycles in `55481bf`; upstream extraction should adapt
one focused contribution at a time and validate each resulting branch.

## NMEA recording controls

- Status: candidate; merged into `dev` through fork [PR #4](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/4)
  on `feature/nmea-recording-controls` from `dev`. Functional commit: `e10f896`.
- Scope: move recording into the shared NMEA component with a DAW transport
  (Restart, Play/Pause, square Stop, red Record toggle). Both stop controls
  preserve the captured data and plots. Remove Save, Clear, and the Logs time
  cursor controls, crop markers, and crop action. Hide playback speed in live
  mode. Loaded logs retain their full plotted track throughout playback, with
  a moving cursor on each subplot.
- Recordings: continuously write interpreted sentences and raw NMEA 2000
  companion archives into the app data directory's `recordings` folder. Each
  capture uses a UTC timestamp and exclusive creation, with a suffix for name
  collisions. Starting another capture and closing the app retain prior files.
  Show the current file path and explicit automatic-saving/stopped status in
  the panel; the native load chooser starts in the recordings folder when it
  exists and retains the interpreted-log file filters.
- Dependencies: shared NMEA session/component and NMEA 2000 recording support
  already present in `dev`; queue upstream extraction on those prerequisites.
- Validation: 92 tests and 8 subtests pass across NMEA session/controls,
  transport/recording, workspace, and polar UI. Tests verify files are readable while
  capture is active, interpreted/raw archives survive shutdown and later
  recordings, name collisions preserve existing files, and both stop controls
  retain identical Matplotlib plots. Playback tests cover full-data plots,
  cursor visibility on every subplot with a Retina/high-DPI canvas, pause,
  restart, EOF, source switching, and hidden live-mode speed controls.
  Static plots are cached; a native 300-point preview measured 505 ms for the
  initial plot and 0.5 ms per cursor redraw including session notifications.
  Existing graph sampling is retained, with the final point always included.
  Black, Flake8, scoped mypy, native panel
  preview, and diff checks pass. Hardware recording has not been exercised.
- Intended upstream scope: session recording ownership, persistent timestamped
  captures, reusable NMEA controls, Logs cleanup, and regression tests.
  Exclude fork tracking.

## Native filesystem pickers

- Status: candidate; merged into `dev` through fork [PR #4](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/4).
  Functional commit: `aa7cdf6`; branch: `feature/nmea-recording-controls`.
- Scope: use one GTK native-picker helper for all ten Open, Save, and folder
  chooser locations: NMEA, GRIB, polar, GPX/track/route/POI, and chart directories.
  Retain filters, default filenames/directories, modal parenting, and overwrite
  confirmation; handle native ACCEPT/CANCEL responses.
- Dependencies: existing picker migrations are independent; the NMEA callsite
  depends on the shared NMEA component.
- Validation: full suite passes 761 tests and 71 subtests. Native Open, Save,
  and Select Folder configuration smoke checks pass. Black, Flake8, scoped
  mypy, and diff checks pass. Polar import tests verify cancellation and import
  with the floating window as parent.
- Intended upstream scope: shared helper and focused callsite migrations,
  with their import/cancel regression coverage. Exclude unrelated NMEA and
  fork tracking changes.

Fork PR #4 pre-merge validation: 761 tests and 71 subtests pass locally.
CI reports an existing complexity failure in `ConnectionEditDialog.__init__`
and four type errors in NMEA 2000 source/settings code. These files are unchanged
by this PR; the complexity failure and all four type errors reproduce on `dev`
in an isolated baseline worktree. With installed optional libraries, local full
mypy reports additional existing library-typing errors on both branches; scoped
checks of the changed source pass. The two full-tree Black formatting differences
are also in unchanged baseline files. No new lint/type failures were introduced.

## Shared map projection and Qt first pass

- Status: reusable projection is an upstream candidate; the Qt frontend is a
  fork-only migration experiment on `feature/qt-first-pass` from merged `dev`.
- Scope: extract existing Mercator/viewport math into a toolkit-independent core
  module, retaining GTK import compatibility. Add an optional PySide6 frontend
  with shared NMEA sessions, native file dialogs, timestamped recordings,
  full-log Matplotlib plots with blitted cursors, a floating NMEA dock, and a
  Cairo/QImage coastline/track canvas. GTK remains the default launcher.
- Dependencies: shared NMEA session, persistent recordings, and viewport work
  already integrated in `dev`. A complete application migration still needs
  production chart/overlay adapters and toolkit-neutral Core scheduling.
- Validation: 762 repository tests and 71 subtests pass; the optional Qt wrapper
  executes seven isolated integration checks. Changed-file Black/Flake8 and
  scoped mypy pass; editable installation and wheel contents are verified.
  Native macOS window controls and playback were visually checked. Projection
  parity: 2,000 coordinates, zero-pixel differences. Small native 180-point
  run: full plot 40.3 ms, cursor 1.84 ms, cached coastline image 2.9 ms. Detailed
  ENC/source-selection parity and hardware input are not established by this pass.
- Review: [fork PR #5](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/5),
  merged into `dev`. Functional commits: `20ba52e` (projection) and
  `ec0bd44` (optional Qt frontend, tests, packaging, and assessment).
- Intended upstream scope: shared projection extraction only; keep the optional
  Qt experiment and fork documentation out of parent-project PRs unless invited.
- Assessment and launch instructions: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

## Qt production charts and Core integration

- Status: shared Core scheduling/chart extraction are upstream candidates;
  the Qt adapter/UI is fork-only. Branch: `feature/qt-production-charts`,
  dependent on `feature/qt-first-pass` and fork PR #5.
- Review: [fork PR #6](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/6),
  retargeted to `dev` after PR #5 merged, then merged into `dev`.
- Scope: inject Core notification scheduling while preserving GTK defaults;
  extract production Cairo chart/wind rendering and settings from GTK; retain
  compatibility imports, palettes, coastline quality thresholds, ENC source/
  scale selection and wind interpolation. GTK retains its GObject chart adapter
  and download dialogs. Qt uses these renderers and the full Core with queued
  worker completions, callback cancellation, chart lifecycle/tick adapters,
  installed chart preferences, wind forecast loading/time selection and boat
  status. The GTK launcher remains the default.
- Functional commits: `4a05215` (Core scheduler and connection-start control),
  `3f99e48` (shared rendering/settings, Cairo S57 sprites and raster worker
  portability), `7f077d9` (interior water in simple coastline polygons),
  `be0b73a` (Qt Core/chart/wind integration and regression coverage).
- Fidelity: all 2,030 S57 day/dark sprites at fractional coordinates match the
  previous GdkPixbuf renderer pixel for pixel. Production projection, source
  selection, half-pixel ENC tolerance and routing calculations are retained.
  The simple coastline renderer now fills polygon rings together with even-odd
  winding, preserving holes; fill/stroke ordering changes with that fix. Raster
  conversion preserves existing palette values and replaces a nested local
  multiprocessing worker with the existing loader thread, allowing macOS spawn.
- Validation: twelve isolated Qt checks pass, including full Core worker delivery,
  stale notifications, callback cancellation, production OGR ENC/raster fixtures,
  palette/forecast changes, retained recordings/full plots and no GTK imports.
  Two toolkit-independent Core scheduler tests and a polygon/multipolygon hole
  regression with two subtests pass. Final full suite: 765 tests and 73
  subtests pass. An earlier concurrent run hit Qt subprocess and existing GTK
  dialog timeouts; both passed in isolation, and the final full run passed.
  The expanded Qt wrapper allows 120 seconds for twelve full-Core checks;
  fixtures isolate user settings and local forecast/polar scans.
  Changed-source Black/Flake8 pass. Full local mypy retains the same 32 baseline
  errors in eight files (symbol parser errors move with its implementation);
  no additional errors. Wheel contents include rendering, settings and schedulers.
  Native macOS QA loaded GSHHS, 31 saved vector layers and three wind sources:
  cached chart image 6.2 ms, ten small pans averaging 7.44 ms; small-log full plot
  86.4 ms and cursor 6.32 ms. Other checks ran concurrently, so these are local
  sample measurements rather than controlled performance comparisons. Hardware,
  current/tide UI and large-chart stress tests are pending.
- Integration: review against `feature/qt-first-pass`; merge PR #5 first, then
  retarget this PR to `dev` and verify the resulting diff/checks. Leave both
  unmerged until approved. No upstream submission is authorized by fork review.
- Intended upstream scope: extract scheduler injection and toolkit-neutral Cairo
  rendering separately after their shared prerequisites land; keep Qt UI,
  migration assessment and fork tracking out of parent-project contributions.
- Assessment and launch instructions: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

Qt pre-merge CI review: targeted naming exceptions allow Qt virtual methods.
CI test collection fails because the existing tox environment omits runtime
`nmeatoolkit`; this predates Qt. Builds/docs pass; existing GTK complexity/type
failures remain. Local full-suite results above remain valid.

Qt integration: fork PRs #5 and #6 merged into `dev` with user approval.
After retargeting #6, 46 focused tests and two subtests passed; new CI runs
were pending at merge. The Qt naming violations are fixed; prior CI test
collection fails on the omitted `nmeatoolkit` tox dependency, with baseline
GTK complexity/type failures unchanged. GTK remains the default frontend.

## Qt wind-only routing workflow

- Status: Qt UI is fork-only; the UI-neutral routing job is an upstream candidate.
  Branch: `feature/qt-routing`, started from `dev` after approved merges of fork
  PRs #5 and #6. No pending branch dependency.
- Review: [fork PR #7](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/7),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `d24a092`).
- Scope: add a Routing dock with polar/algorithm selection, local departure time,
  start/destination coordinates, boat-position and saved-POI shortcuts, map
  context actions, coastline checks, background calculation/progress/cancel,
  automatically saved results, a result selector, fit-to-route and a waypoint
  table with map highlighting. Existing saved routes use the shared Core model.
  Cancellation/errors/window closure retain prior routes and drop late results.
- Functional commits: `ca88f0a` (shared routing job and engine/sampling tests),
  `3943d63` (Qt workflow and isolated integration coverage). Follow-up commits
  `f0cb4c9` and `3823537` keep compact map/table labels visible and handle the
  nullable Qt header API. Final focused tests and scoped mypy pass.
- Fidelity: uses Core's existing wind-only routing algorithm, defaults, source
  priority, interpolation, coastline hooks and result serialization. A direct
  constant-wind calculation matches the existing engine's route points exactly;
  real raster sampling matches at four times including fractional hours. Private
  GDAL handles and two-hour job-local caches are closed on success/error/cancel.
  Existing arrival tolerance is retained, so the last generated point can be
  before the destination; the UI displays its time and keeps the requested
  destination visible when fitting, without synthesizing a final route leg.
- Validation: full suite passes 769 tests and 73 subtests. Sixteen isolated Qt
  checks include actual engine completion, distinct result names, result/waypoint
  selection, map fitting/highlighting, cancellation, shutdown, prior-result
  retention, missing wind and invalid positions. Temporary on-disk route storage
  reloads through the same collection used by GTK, retaining points, active route
  and provenance. Four toolkit-independent job tests cover parity, sampling,
  cancellation and absent forecasts. The final targeted rerun passes after
  improving the empty-wind error message and algorithm label. Changed-source
  Black/Flake8 (including pep8-naming) pass; mypy retains the same 32 baseline
  errors in eight files, with no new errors. Native macOS QA calculated against
  installed forecasts and inspected charts, the dock, points and route display;
  user settings writes were disabled and GTK was absent from the Qt process.
- Limits: wind-only with existing algorithm defaults. Current-aware routing,
  automatic downloads, parameter editing, scenario comparison, track destinations
  and route editing/export remain pending. The default launcher remains GTK.
- Intended upstream scope: extract the cancellable routing job separately if
  useful upstream; keep Qt controls and fork migration documentation out of
  parent-project contributions. No upstream publication is authorized here.
- Assessment and launch instructions: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

## Qt visual integration

- Status: Qt presentation is fork-only; the shared route-speed palette extraction
  is an upstream candidate. Branch: `feature/qt-visual-integration`, dependent on
  `feature/qt-routing` and fork PR #7. After #7 merged, retargeted to `dev`
  and verified the focused presentation diff before integration.
- Review: [fork PR #8](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/8),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `c246cfc`).
- Scope: align the optional Qt workspace with GTK's dark presentation using a
  dark Fusion palette, rounded controls, blue accents, consistent spacing,
  symbolic icons and dark Matplotlib plots. Replace the fixed map/plots split
  and two opposing sidebars with full-size Charts/Logs views and grouped NMEA/
  Routing panels on the right. Keep native window controls and filesystem
  dialogs. Routing separates Plan and Results, automatically shows completed
  results and keeps progress/Calculate/Cancel outside the scrolling form.
  Loading a log selects Logs; routing calculation selects Charts. Native File/
  Navigate menus, shortcuts and toolbar panel access make the migrated views
  easier to reach. Dock floating/hiding remains available.
- Functional commits: `ba0abe1` (shared route speed colors; GTK compatibility),
  `1acd87c` (Qt theme, plots, view/sidebar integration and regression coverage),
  `916ec79` (compact form wrapping and bounded combo sizing).
- Fidelity: map route segments use GTK's existing speed thresholds/colors;
  NMEA tracks use the shared GTK log-track style. Plot series use GTK's speed,
  true-wind and heading colors with amber cursors. Chart palettes remain
  independent of the UI theme. Production Cairo chart/wind rendering, source
  selection, projection, routing calculations and playback data are unchanged.
- Validation: 769 repository tests and 73 subtests pass. The optional Qt wrapper
  executes seventeen isolated checks, including view/panel transitions while
  retaining playback, full curves, map position and chart palette; results-page
  selection, route-speed data and visible compact-window Calculate/Cancel.
  Changed-file Black/Flake8 including naming checks and scoped Qt mypy pass.
  Full local mypy retains 32 baseline errors in eight files, with no new errors.
  Native macOS screenshots checked routing results, Charts, Logs, dark plots,
  transport glyphs, native window buttons and the Plan form at 1280×820 and
  1000×650. At 1000×650 both action buttons are visible without scrolling the
  form; final native and isolated checks also verify zero horizontal scrolling.
  A real forecast route and 180-point playback ran without GTK imports;
  user settings writes were disabled during QA.
- Limits: platform fonts/decorations still differ; Qt workspace persistence,
  unmigrated tools and compact traffic-light/toolbar layout remain pending.
  GTK remains the default launcher. No upstream publication is part of this task.
- Assessment and launch instructions: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

Integration verification for fork PRs #7 and #8: the final targeted run of
`test_qt_preview.py`, `test_geomaplayer.py` and `test_routingjob.py` passes
11 tests and 9 subtests, including the isolated Qt integration checks. The
retargeted presentation diff passes `git diff --check`. GitHub builds pass;
CI test collection still lacks `nmeatoolkit`, and lint/type jobs retain the
previously documented GTK complexity and four type errors. Both PRs are merged
into `dev`; no upstream PR was created or updated.

## Qt connection settings and data library

- Status: Qt UI is fork-only. Connection configuration validation, replacement
  lifecycle and nonblocking status snapshots are an upstream candidate.
  Branch: `feature/qt-settings-data`, started from `dev` after approved merges
  of fork PRs #7 and #8. No pending branch dependency.
- Review: [fork PR #9](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/9),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `ac8beef`).
  Merge audit confirmed CI failures remain the missing `nmeatoolkit` dependency,
  existing GTK complexity and four existing type errors; all builds pass.
- Scope: serial/TCP/UDP connection add/edit/remove with draft Apply, legacy N2K
  format loading, input-only N2K validation and offline-safe persistence; Qt
  display preferences; a Forecasts/Charts library with local imports, enable
  flags, removal and provider downloads. Native system pickers remain the
  default. Start/reconnect work, forecast I/O and chart indexing run in workers;
  chart/forecast model installation and Qt notifications run on the UI thread.
- Functional commits: `28417f0` (shared connection configuration/lifecycle and
  unit tests), `f66165b` (Qt settings/library, background work and integration
  checks). Follow-ups `e86df9c` (palette-raster validation) and `26c072d`
  (stable chart ordering) pass the final isolated Qt reruns.
- Fidelity: preserves existing instrument data sources, GRIB source priority,
  wind sampling, chart rendering and routing calculations. Connection edits
  use the same storage as GTK. GRIB imports stage and validate before installing
  library copies, preserving original files and adding timestamp suffixes on
  filename collisions. Chart toggles/reimports preserve layer ordering.
  NOAA GFS/OpenSkiron use existing provider APIs; GFS bounds
  are explicit. NOAA ENC uses the existing coverage catalog/cache and atomic
  exchange-set installer. Imported chart metadata and enable flags use GTK's
  settings schema. Chart removal retains files; forecast-copy removal asks
  confirmation and protects externally opened files. Base charts are read-only.
- Validation: full suite passes 776 tests and 79 subtests. The optional Qt wrapper
  runs 24 isolated checks, adding shared disk reloads, legacy N2K editing/offline
  saves, forecast import/toggle/removal/collisions, real vector/raster indexing,
  palette callback attachment, staged provider failure/success, NOAA coverage,
  connection-worker responsiveness with playback and late-completion rejection.
  Final scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy pass; full local mypy retains the same 32
  baseline errors in eight files. Native macOS QA checked Settings/Display and
  both library pages with installed data and compact chart actions; GTK remained
  absent and user settings writes were disabled. Provider responses and physical
  instrument hardware were not tested live. Existing CI dependency/lint/type
  failures remain documented above.
- Limits: provider-specific timeout/cancellation behavior is retained; no new
  download Cancel control. Base GSHHS installation, polar management, current-
  aware routing and workspace persistence remain separate migration slices.
  GTK remains the default frontend. No upstream publication is authorized.
- Intended upstream scope: extract connection validation/replacement/status
  handling independently if useful. Keep Qt controls and fork documentation
  out of parent-project submissions.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

## Qt workspace parity with GTK

- Status: Qt UI is fork-only; the toolkit-neutral polar renderer extraction is
  an upstream candidate. Branch: `feature/qt-workspace-parity`, based on `dev`
  at `77a9e2b` after the approved merge of fork PR #11. No pending dependency
  or upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #12](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/12),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `f5f18d6`). Merge audit confirmed
  the existing connection-dialog complexity and four baseline CI type errors;
  docs passed, with build/test jobs still running at integration. Local validation
  is recorded below.
- Functional commits: `7f34bb8` (shared production polar renderer and GTK
  adapter), `1bec52e` (Qt workspace, panels, plots and preference integration).
- Scope: preserve GTK's Charts/Logs/Polars workspace organization and contextual
  toolbars. Polars shows its speed table beside the full-circle chart, with
  shared-dock Polar manager, Polar selector, NMEA and Performance panels.
  Performance uses the shared active history, STW/SOG basis and wind-band policy;
  clearing performance samples retains NMEA logs and plots. Logs shows an
  independent map above full-data plots, GTK series switches/colors and local
  time labels, with independent forecast time and camera. Preferences retain
  both map views, splits, series switches and Polars choices; older Qt toolbar
  layouts migrate to the new workspace header.
- Fidelity: original Cairo polar curves, colors, grid, mirroring, sample rendering
  and hover logic are shared without changing formulas or constants. Six direct
  baseline comparisons at three sizes, with and without hover/measured samples,
  produced zero changed pixels. Table row stride and speed values match GTK;
  polar parsing, enabled flags and routing calculations remain unchanged.
- Validation: full suite passed 783 tests and 84 subtests before the final
  manager-dock/time-label polish; the final Qt wrapper passed all 38 isolated
  checks. Targeted GTK performance/manager and Qt checks passed (14 tests and
  three subtests). Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy pass; full mypy retains 32
  baseline errors in eight files. Native macOS GTK/Qt comparison verified the
  Polars table/chart, Performance and Logs layout at 1280×820; Qt also fits
  1000×650. QA disabled user-settings writes and used temporary workspace paths;
  GTK was absent from the Qt process. Live hardware was not exercised.
- Limits: remaining POI/track/AIS tools, marine overlays, dashboard, forecast
  controls and routing parameters are listed in `docs/qt-parity.md`. Qt native
  chrome/fonts differ; this is structural parity, not complete UI parity.
  GTK remains the default launcher. Automatic recording, retained playback
  plots/cursors and native filesystem pickers remain in place.
- Intended upstream scope: the shared polar renderer can be reviewed separately
  from Qt UI and fork migration documentation. No upstream publication is
  authorized by this slice.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt workspace persistence

- Status: fork-only Qt UI. Branch: `feature/qt-workspace`, started from `dev`
  after the approved merge of fork PR #9 and its integration tracking update.
  No pending branch dependency; no upstream submission is part of this slice.
- Review: [fork PR #10](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/10),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `6d08001`).
  Merge audit confirmed the existing dependency/lint/type CI failures only;
  all build jobs pass.
- Scope: restore and autosave normal/maximized window bounds, dock placement/
  sizing/visibility, detached panel bounds, Navigation toolbar visibility,
  active sidebar and Charts/Logs view, map center/zoom, routing view/polar/
  algorithm/coastline preferences and selected saved route, NMEA speed and
  live-stream preference. View can reopen hidden controls or reset the layout.
- Functional commit: `0014dd1` (Qt preferences, viewport notifications, close/
  application-quit flushing and five isolated integration checks).
- Storage: reuse `WorkspaceStateStore`'s versioned atomic writes in a separate
  `workspace-qt.json`; GTK retains `workspace.json`. Save after 750 ms idle,
  defer during map drag/animation, skip identical states and flush on close.
  Failed writes retain the previous file and can retry. Qt layout decoding is
  bounded/validated; malformed data falls back safely. Main/detached bounds are
  fitted to available monitor work areas. Maximization waits for native show
  so returning to normal mode retains the saved size.
- Fidelity: no calculation, forecast, instrument or chart-rendering changes.
  Preferences exclude loaded log paths/samples, playback cursor, recording state,
  route draft coordinates/departure and running jobs. Restoration does not
  reopen logs or start recording/playback/calculation. A route selection is a
  name referencing the existing shared route collection.
- Validation: full repository suite passes 776 tests and 79 subtests. The Qt
  wrapper now runs 29 isolated checks. New checks cover disk restart with hidden/
  floating docks and toolbar, normal/maximized bounds, selected views/options,
  missing monitors and malformed fields/layout, reset recovery, debounce during
  drag/playback, atomic save failure/retry and exclusion of instrument history.
  Final targeted run passes after adding toolbar recovery coverage. Changed-file
  Black/Flake8 and scoped Qt mypy pass; full mypy retains 32 baseline errors in
  eight files. Native macOS QA reopened the workspace repeatedly and verified
  1000×650 normal bounds, active Routing/Results, map 48.3/-123.5/9.5, detached
  430×500 panel bounds and maximize-to-normal restoration. GTK was absent and
  user settings writes were disabled; workspace writes used a temporary path.
- Limits: layout is Qt-specific rather than translated between frontends. Dialog
  positions, log reloads and route drafts are not restored. GTK remains the
  default launcher; polar management and current-aware routing are pending.
- Intended upstream scope: keep Qt UI/preferences and migration documentation
  fork-only unless the parent adopts a Qt frontend. The shared atomic store is
  reused without changes.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

## Qt polar management

- Status: Qt UI is fork-only. Shared polar-library lifecycle fixes and validated,
  staged file/provider helpers are upstream candidates. Branch: `feature/qt-polars`,
  started from `dev` after the approved merge of fork PR #10 and its tracking
  update. No pending branch dependency; no upstream submission is authorized.
- Review: [fork PR #11](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/11),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `f52fc91`).
  Merge audit confirmed existing dependency/lint/type failures only; builds pass.
- Scope: Data Library Polars page, File → Polars and Routing → Manage polars;
  native `.pol` imports, enable/remove controls, curve/full-table previews,
  enabled-polar routing selection and searchable ORC catalog/downloads. Provider
  work and parsing run in workers; shared manager updates run on the UI thread.
  Mutation controls serialize against data operations and route calculations;
  window shutdown drops late notifications and model installation.
- Functional commits: `782ae24` (shared manager/file lifecycle and seven tests),
  `690557b` (Qt workflows and four additional isolated integration checks).
  Follow-up `f422ced` defers table refresh until checkbox events finish;
  the final Qt/shared tests pass with actual checkbox toggles.
- Selection fix: the previous shared refresh appended every local file to both
  installed and enabled lists. Refresh now rebuilds the installed index without
  duplicating or enabling files; explicitly empty enabled selections survive
  restart. Deletes remove enable flags/metadata and stage the file for recovery
  if persistence fails. Qt routing now lists enabled files only, refreshes after
  changes and preserves an available selection; no enabled file disables Calculate.
- Fidelity: imports preserve bytes and use the same routing engine parser and
  interpolation. Validation rejects invalid axes, ragged tables and negative/
  nonfinite speeds before installing. Collision suffixes preserve existing files.
  Sixteen interpolation probes and full table/axis comparisons match the original
  file exactly. ORC conversion reuses `json_to_polars` unchanged, including its
  rounding/endpoints; invalid converted tables are rejected. Requests use the
  existing ORC endpoints with explicit timeouts. Preview curves use stored points
  directly; no calculation formulas, efficiencies or approximations change.
- Validation: full suite passes 783 tests and 84 subtests. The Qt wrapper runs 33
  isolated checks, including native-picker import, shared disk reload, immediate
  route-selection updates, exact preview/table values, ORC proxy filtering and
  download metadata, network failure, mutation blocking and late-close delivery.
  Shared tests cover duplicate refresh, empty enabled reload, collision-safe
  imports, unchanged interpolation, invalid data, failed-copy/delete recovery,
  ORC conversion and retaining symlink targets. Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy pass;
  full mypy retains the same 32 baseline errors in eight files. Native macOS QA
  inspected library/search, curves, full table and selecting an imported polar
  for Routing. User storage writes were disabled, polar/workspace writes used
  temporary paths and GTK was absent. Live ORC responses were not exercised.
- Limits: ORC catalog is fetched on demand without a persistent catalog cache;
  requests have timeouts but no new download Cancel control. Live polar
  performance, efficiency controls, polar editing/export and current-aware
  routing remain pending. GTK remains the default frontend.
- Intended upstream scope: prepare focused shared library/file-validation changes
  separately from Qt controls and fork documentation. No upstream publication
  is part of this migration slice.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.

## Qt chart navigation

- Status: Qt controls and migration documentation are fork-only. Shared GTK
  navigation/AIS renderers and routing summary are upstream candidates. Branch:
  `feature/qt-navigation`, based on `dev` at `6fa2aad` after the approved merge
  of fork PR #12. No pending dependency or upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #13](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/13),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `bebac38`). Build and docs jobs
  passed. Merge audit confirmed the existing missing-`nmeatoolkit` test-environment
  failure, connection-dialog complexity warning and four baseline CI type errors;
  the other test-matrix jobs were cancelled. Local validation is recorded below.
- Functional commits: `8ec23d3` (shared production Cairo route/track/POI/AIS
  portrayal and routing summary, preserving GTK adapters/import paths),
  `45110ee` (Qt Navigation panel, map actions, native GPX/PFEC workflows and
  workspace preferences).
- Scope: GTK's Tracks/Routings/POIs/AIS tab order in a left Navigation panel;
  Charts-only visibility with the Tabs toggle, draggable/floating docks and
  restart preferences. Shared collections support editable names/visibility,
  active tracks, waypoint addition/order/duplication/removal, map placement and
  Escape/view-change cancellation, route selection/summary/waypoints/removal,
  POI routing-destination refresh and fit actions. GPX parsing/validation runs
  on a worker, installs tracks/waypoints on the UI thread and drops late close
  completions. Native import/export pickers use shared converters/GPX objects.
  AIS uses existing active-target expiry, GTK distance ordering and category
  colors, with map visibility for both Charts and Logs.
- Fidelity: no routing formulas, navigation coordinates, JSON schemas or AIS
  decoding/source selection change. Track/POI/routing/AIS drawing reuses the
  original GTK code, including styles, route-time interpolation, exclusion marks,
  marker orientation/vectors and label spacing. Twelve direct comparisons to
  pre-extraction GTK at three sizes and two pixel scales, with/without selection,
  produced zero changed pixels. Track distances display two decimals with nm;
  stored coordinates and underlying length calculations retain full precision.
  Routing summaries and PFEC conversion retain the existing GTK behavior.
- Validation: full suite passed 783 tests and 84 subtests; final Qt wrapper passed
  all 43 isolated checks, followed by a passing targeted route-waypoint selection
  check after the final signal connection. Five new checks cover track/POI/map
  editing/cancel, shared disk reloads, native-picker GPX import/export, invalid
  coordinates, route controls, AIS ordering/expiry, workspace restart and late
  import shutdown. Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy pass; full mypy retains 32 baseline
  errors in eight files. Native macOS GTK and Qt comparison verified the left
  navigation/tab organization and all four Qt tabs at 1280×820; Qt also fits
  1000×650. A stacked Navigation/Routing layout regression was caught and fixed
  with scrolling content before the final checks. QA disabled user-settings
  writes and used temporary workspace/navigation storage or in-memory fixtures;
  GTK was absent from the Qt process. Live hardware was not exercised.
- Limits: GPX route elements are not imported, matching the existing GTK importer;
  tracks and waypoints are supported. Download/provider controls, marine layers,
  dashboard, forecast shortcuts and advanced routing remain separate slices.
  The existing Routing plan/results dock remains available alongside the new
  navigation results tab. GTK remains the default frontend; native Qt widgets
  and table formatting differ while workspace structure/data remain aligned.
- Intended upstream scope: extract the shared portrayal/summary separately from
  Qt controls and fork documentation if authorized. No upstream publication is
  part of this slice.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt map instruments and cursor wind

- Status: Qt controls/preferences and migration documentation are fork-only.
  Shared dashboard/gauges, responsive layout and cursor worker lifecycle are
  upstream candidates. Branch: `feature/qt-map-instruments`, based on `dev`
  at `c837717` after the approved merge of fork PR #13. No pending dependency
  or upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #14](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/14),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `748e5c7`). Merge audit confirmed
  the existing missing-`nmeatoolkit` test-environment failure, connection-dialog
  complexity and four baseline CI type errors. Docs and completed builds passed;
  macOS/Python 3.10 builds were still running at integration.
- Functional commits: `e80d964` (shared production gauges/dashboard and injectable
  cursor scheduling, retaining GTK adapters), `85f3aa4` (wrap all gauges on narrow
  maps, shared by GTK/Qt), `55c53ff` (private cursor forecast metadata and explicit
  dataset release), `b4df8f3` (Qt instrument/readout integration and preferences).
  Validation follow-up `6e6668c` probes distinct raster cells as well as times.
- Scope: GTK's seven instrument gauges and connection summary on Charts/Logs;
  Core playback/live readings, retained Stop readings and source-reset clearing.
  Independent Dashboard/Grib toggles persist for both maps. Immediate pointer
  coordinates and debounced asynchronous forecast wind appear in the status bar;
  connection refresh leaves an active readout visible. Forecast/source/view changes,
  map motion/leave/hide, point placement and shutdown cancel stale queries.
  Instrument updates reuse chart images and status polling uses the existing
  nonblocking connection snapshot.
- Fidelity: reported true wind and the original apparent-wind/SOG fallback,
  units, color thresholds and missing/zero handling are retained without changing
  recorded data. Sixteen comparisons against original GTK gauge/dashboard code
  at two sizes, two pixel scales and four states produce zero changed pixels on
  wide maps. Narrow maps intentionally wrap the same gauges in order instead
  of clipping the fixed row. No routing, forecast sampling or source-order changes:
  the cursor retains GTK enabled-file order/fallback and the 1.94384 knots
  conversion; the wind overlay retains its separate newest-run ordering.
  Twelve time/position probes across distinct real raster cells match legacy
  wind values exactly. Each cursor worker owns at most two private files/four
  array hours per file; eviction and shutdown release datasets, avoiding the
  inherited shared forecast-hour cache retaining the last handle.
- Validation: full suite passed 791 tests and 101 subtests before final status-line
  visibility polish; final Qt wrapper passed all 49 isolated checks afterward.
  The raster-gradient follow-up passed three tests and 12 subtests. Shared dashboard/
  cursor/GTK tests passed 20 tests and 17 subtests; existing GTK workspace/cursor
  checks also passed. Six new Qt checks cover playback/Stop/reset readings, chart
  image reuse, independent map preference restart, hidden/moving query suppression,
  worker/UI delivery and debounce, stale-result cancellation, real forecast values,
  blocked-worker close and visible cursor text during refresh. Scoped Black/Flake8
  and mypy pass; full mypy retains 32 baseline errors in eight files. Native macOS
  GTK/Qt comparison checked wide/wrapped dashboards, Logs, toggles and synthetic
  pointer readout on a real local GDAL fixture at 1280×820 and 1000×650; Qt imports
  no GTK and closes its cursor cache. QA disabled user-settings writes and used
  temporary workspace/raster data. Live hardware/providers were not exercised.
- Limits: marine cursor values/overlays, forecast timeline shortcuts, advanced
  routing parameters and full GTK control parity remain separate slices. Cursor
  file priority intentionally follows existing GTK cursor behavior rather than
  changing it to the wind overlay's issue-time ordering. GTK remains the default
  frontend; both processes continue to run independently.
- Intended upstream scope: review extraction, responsive dashboard and cursor
  resource fixes independently from Qt UI and fork documentation if authorized.
  No upstream publication is part of this migration slice.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt forecast timeline and floating panel integration

- Status: shared forecast metadata/stepping is an upstream candidate; Qt controls,
  panel chrome/theme and migration documentation are fork-only. Branch:
  `feature/qt-forecast-timeline`, based on `dev` at `e9555fe` after the approved
  merge of fork PR #14. No pending prerequisite or upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #15](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/15),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `6962a63`). All Linux builds and
  docs passed. CI failures match the existing connection-dialog complexity, four
  type errors and missing `nmeatoolkit` test dependency; remaining test jobs were
  cancelled by CI fail-fast. macOS build was still running at integration.
- Functional commits: `0a54892` extracts GTK's enabled-source intervals, union
  bounds, step choices and bounded/unbounded stepping without changing semantics;
  `949b7b7` adds the Qt timeline/preferences and integrates the other agent's
  floating panel chrome, scrolling/theme and Window menu changes. That integration
  also fixes child-relative resize coordinates, duplicate resize helpers, lint/
  typing issues and teardown callbacks accessing already-deleted Qt objects.
- Scope: GTK-ordered forecast transport and step interval, local-time picker and
  Charts-only range slider on the existing toolbar row. Play advances once per
  second and pauses at the endpoint; slider changes coalesce at 75 ms. Metadata
  bounds include enabled GRIBs, marine fields and stations, support dates beyond
  2038, and do not sample/open data. Manual dates outside the range remain valid
  with a caption. NMEA transport/recording and routing departure stay independent.
  Restore retains only the step interval, with no autoplay or selected-time restore.
  Floating panels retain dock tabs/splits, add compact headers, edge resize/snap,
  double-click docking and Window → Reset Panels. Thin scrolling bars and the
  unfocused dropdown/spinner wheel guard are included, with dark native macOS
  appearance matching the existing dark palette. Filesystem dialogs remain native.
- Fidelity: shared bounds/stepping retain GTK's local time, hourly Now rounding,
  elapsed-time bounded steps and wall-time unbounded steps, including DST folds.
  Union bounds can include gaps; they do not promise continuous coverage. No
  forecast interpolation, route calculation or source priority changes.
- Validation: full suite passes 794 tests and 101 subtests; final Qt wrapper passes
  all 57 checks and exits normally after the destruction regression test was
  strengthened. Shared timeline/GTK/time-control checks pass 31 tests. Scoped
  Black/Flake8 and mypy (23 files) pass. Full mypy retains 32 baseline errors in
  eight existing files. Sphinx was unavailable locally; documentation CI is pending.
  Native macOS Qt checked 1280×820 and 1000×650, metadata
  ranges, scrubbing, endpoint pause, unchanged routing departure, manual outside
  dates, hidden Logs controls, floating panel/reset and clean shutdown; GTK
  reference checked at 1280×820. QA used temporary workspace/raster data with
  user-settings writes disabled. Live hardware/providers were not exercised.
- Limits: marine controls/overlays, broader settings and advanced routing remain
  pending. GTK remains the default frontend and retains its controls. Floating
  snap behavior has not been validated on Linux/Windows or multiple monitors.
- Intended upstream scope: consider the shared forecast extraction separately
  from Qt UI and fork documentation if authorized; no upstream publication is
  part of this slice.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt marine controls and overlays

- Status: shared marine rendering, coverage helpers, interval summaries and tide
  acquisition are upstream candidates; Qt controls/preferences and migration
  documentation are fork-only. Branch: `feature/qt-marine-controls`, based on
  `dev` at `2fddc69` after the approved merge of fork PR #15. No pending dependency
  or upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #16](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/16),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `bf1da59`). All builds, including
  macOS, and docs passed. CI failures match the existing connection-dialog
  complexity, four type errors and missing `nmeatoolkit` test dependency;
  remaining test jobs were cancelled by fail-fast.
- Functional commits: `1376489` extracts production marine rendering/shoreline
  masking and pure coverage/tide-download/interval helpers while retaining GTK
  compatibility modules and APIs; `4a54dc4` integrates separate Qt Currents/Tides
  tools, source settings, account controls, overlay/cursor portrayal and preferences.
- Scope: Charts-only Currents and Tides panels, independent display switches,
  map-area or saved-track/route coverage, UTC start following chart time until
  edited, 1–168 hours, worker acquisition, progress/cancel and UI-thread persistence.
  Current model groups retain merged intervals, partial Use state, download removal
  and metadata. Tides retain automatic CHS selection, usable-sample cache reuse,
  missing-span acquisition, height values and enabled automatic downloads. Marine
  settings include individual saved station sources, priority/fallback/removal,
  UTC samples, units, QC/qualifiers and provenance. Settings → Currents uses the
  existing system credential store with cleared password drafts. Workspace restore
  retains panels/display only and starts no downloads; Reset Panels closes marine
  tools even when invoked from Logs. Existing native filesystem pickers remain.
- Fidelity: the production Cairo renderer is shared, retaining fixed knots
  scale/flow-toward bearings, station source-datum labels, source ranking, masks,
  missing-data rules, shoreline clipping and time-only preview behavior. Sixteen
  direct byte comparisons against the pre-migration GTK renderer (two pixel
  scales, four times, valid/masked fields, currents and station predictions) have
  zero changed pixels. The Qt adapter injects UI scheduling and cancels/disconnects
  on hide/close. Logs retains its independent NMEA clock with no marine overlay;
  no routing calculations, interpolation, units or source policies change.
- Validation: full suite passes 794 tests and 101 subtests; the final isolated Qt
  wrapper passes all 65 checks after strengthened priority/reset/checkbox assertions.
  Follow-up `8a87b14` isolates restarted windows from installed shoreline data; its
  focused restart check also passes.
  Existing marine/model/GTK checks pass 94 tests. Eight new Qt checks cover grouped
  source selection/removal and coverage, tide values/display/provenance/priority,
  frozen requests/UI-thread commits, provider partial failure, cancel/close late
  results, dateline tide selection and saved-data reuse, workspace/start behavior,
  worker/cursor integration and account controls. Native macOS GTK/Qt comparison
  checked marine panels/portrayal at 1280×820; Qt also checked 1000×650, details,
  floating/reset, correct active tab and clean shutdown without GTK imports.
  QA used temporary model/workspace data and disabled user-settings writes.
  Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy (29 files) pass. Full mypy retains 32 baseline errors
  in eight existing files. Sphinx is unavailable locally; docs CI passed.
- Integration fixes: defer source-table rebuilds until checkbox signals finish
  to avoid deleting a live native item; force tab activation when a pre-show raise
  left a marine dock last in sibling order behind another active tab. Tests use
  private shoreline paths and preserve the compact floating-panel resize scenario.
- Limits: no live provider/account/network or hardware validation in this slice;
  existing provider limits/qualification remain. Advanced current-aware routing
  options, remaining settings and packaging are separate slices. GTK stays the
  default frontend; no upstream publication is authorized or included.
- Intended upstream scope: extract shared marine portrayal and pure acquisition/
  presentation helpers independently from Qt UI and fork documentation if requested.
- Usage and assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt routing options and current-aware calculations

- Status: candidate for shared routing helpers; Qt frontend and fork migration
  documentation remain fork-only pending an explicit upstream request.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-routing-options`, independent from `dev` at `5b4363d`
  after approved marine PR #16; synchronized with `e9053e1` (merged map
  smoothness PR #17). No pending merge dependency or upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #18](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/18),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `fced2da`). Docs CI passed;
  lint/type failures match the existing connection-dialog complexity and four
  type errors. Other CI jobs were still running at merge time.
- Functional commits: `1daf76b` adds immutable parameter/scenario inputs and
  toolkit-neutral current preparation to the shared worker job; `2f35fcc` migrates
  Qt routing parameters, start/track choices, Compare/Currents pages, sequential
  scenario saves, coverage confirmation and workspace preferences.
- Scope: Plan uses engine metadata for parameters and supports boat/POI/manual or
  first-track-point starts. Track coordinates and parameters are snapshotted.
  Compare retains GTK's four axes, Cartesian order, names and absolute efficiency;
  invalid values and batches above 256 scenarios are rejected before calculation.
  Completed scenarios survive later errors/cancellation. Currents retains existing
  latest-wind preparation, preflight, blocked/nonblocked warning behavior and
  bounded automatic recovery/prefetch. Download persistence and result commits
  use UI handoffs; cancel/close dismisses pending dialogs and rejects late work.
  Options restore without starting downloads/calculations. Current fields are
  frozen at batch start; automatically acquired fields remain available to the
  current run through the existing recovery mechanism and are persisted for later
  calculations. Existing native filesystem pickers remain unchanged.
- Fidelity: default Core calls and GTK remain compatible. Direct comparisons with
  the original engines produce identical point tuples for a parameterized,
  multi-waypoint wind scenario (efficiency/speed/direction changes) and a current
  route. Current UTC timestamps, wind-bearing units and source/coverage provenance
  match GTK. No interpolation, approximation or source priority changes. Engine
  concurrency serializes private GDAL reads to avoid simultaneous dataset access.
- Validation: full suite passes 801 tests and 101 subtests, repeated after
  integrating map smoothness PR #17 (81.71s); isolated Qt wrapper
  passes all 73 integration checks. Seven pure checks cover exact engine parity,
  immutable parameters, scenarios/validation, serialized wind reads, blocked
  preflight and automatic preparation hooks. Eight Qt checks cover parameter
  metadata/cache, four-scenario results and UI-thread commits, frozen tracks/POI
  starts, actual current calculation/provenance, modal cancel/close, automatic
  persistence callbacks, partial batch cancellation and preference restoration.
  Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy (29 files, silent imported modules) pass. Full
  Flake8 retains the existing connection-dialog C901; full mypy retains the same
  32 errors in eight existing files (215 checked).
- Native QA: separate macOS GTK/Qt fixture processes reviewed routing controls,
  Compare/Currents tabs and a successful current result; Qt 1000×650 keeps
  Calculate/Cancel reachable and closes without GTK imports. Fixtures used
  temporary marine/workspace data, disabled settings writes and no live providers.
  Qt widget captures were used because the OS screenshot command crashed; window
  chrome capture is not part of this verification. Sphinx remains unavailable.
- Limits: live routing downloads/accounts/hardware and distributable bundles are
  unvalidated. Computed-route waypoint editing, remaining settings and chart setup
  stay separate. GTK remains the default entry point.
- Intended upstream scope: selected toolkit-neutral options/worker helpers and
  tests, adapted against freshly fetched parent master only if requested; exclude
  Qt UI, fork workflow and migration documentation.
- Usage/assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt map pan and zoom smoothness

- Status: Qt UI is fork-only. Branch: `feature/qt-map-smooth-pan`, based on
  `dev` with no pending prerequisite. No upstream submission.
- Review: [fork PR #17](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/17),
  targeted at `dev`.
- Scope: cache the Qt base, navigation and dashboard layer images with data
  keys and shift them for pans within 128px; ease wheel input toward an
  accumulated zoom target with the cursor anchor pinned, painting scaled
  previews until convergence; defer overlay-driven invalidations arriving
  mid-gesture to release/settle. Log-track polylines are capped at 1500
  points. Shared renderers and the GTK frontend are untouched.
- Fidelity: cached track projections remap affinely into moved views, verified
  bit-exact against fresh projection; zoom lands exactly on the accumulated
  target with zero anchor drift. Exposed pan edges show flat sea color until
  the next sharp rebuild.
- Validation: all 57 isolated Qt checks pass; flake8 clean on changed files.
  Offscreen measurement with a 4,000-point track: zoom frame 4.1 ms down to
  2.0 ms. Behavior checks confirm zero rebuilds on small pans, single
  rebuilds on large jumps/settle/data changes, and deferred mid-drag worker
  completions.
- Intended upstream scope: none; Qt UI work stays out of parent-project PRs.

## GRIB isobars on the weather display

- Status: candidate for upstream; branch `feature/isobars`, based on `dev`
  with no pending prerequisite. No fork PR is open yet; nothing is merged or
  submitted until the user approves.
- Scope: GFS downloads request mean-sea-level pressure (PRMSL) alongside
  10 m wind; `Grib` reads and time-interpolates pressure in hPa with the same
  bracketing logic as wind, so routing and existing wind-only files are
  unchanged (files without pressure bands simply show no isobars). The shared
  wind overlay crops, merges (newest forecast wins) and draws 4 hPa isobars
  with value labels above the wind fill in both the Qt and GTK frontends,
  behind a `gribIsobarsVisible` display setting (default on).
- Fidelity: contouring runs on the native model grid via contourpy with no
  smoothing or resampling; pressure interpolation matches wind interpolation.
  No routing calculations, units or source-selection behavior change.
- Validation: 12 new `test/test_isobars.py` checks (pressure interpolation in
  hPa, missing-band graceful skip, display crop/cache bounds, newest-wins
  merge, legacy palette handling, line/label painting, hidden setting,
  ragged-column and flat-field cases) plus updated GFS filter expectations.
  Full suite passes 805 tests and 101 subtests; isolated Qt checks pass 65.
  End-to-end overlay render on a synthetic GFS-style file shows isobars
  contributing ~3k differing pixels when enabled and byte-identical output
  when disabled. Changed files are Black/Flake8 clean with no new mypy
  errors; one repo-wide Flake8 C901 and the full-mypy baseline errors are
  pre-existing.
- Limits: isobars appear only in GRIBs that carry MSL pressure bands, so
  previously downloaded wind-only files need a re-download. Live GFS
  download of the new filter mix has not been exercised.
- Intended upstream scope: pressure download params, `Grib.get_pressure`,
  and the shared isobar portrayal as one focused contribution, excluding
  fork workflow files.

## Qt base map setup and downloads

- Status: candidate for shared map-data acquisition and base-chart reload helpers;
  Qt UI and fork migration documentation remain fork-only pending an explicit
  upstream request. No upstream submission.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-map-data-setup` from `dev` at `15a1c06`, including
  approved routing PR #18 and the other agent's merged isobars PR #19. No pending
  merge dependency or retargeting.
- Review: [fork PR #20](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/20),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `3b8fae7`). Before merging,
  synchronized with PR #23; all production/test Python ASTs match the validated
  combined preview (90 Qt checks).
- Functional commits: `d4f2da0` adds staged, cancellable, validated map-data
  installation, shared source URLs and idempotent base-chart loading/reload;
  `b1ed730` adds Qt Settings → Map Data, progress/cancel/retry, online startup
  offer, worker/UI handoffs and routing/library serialization.
- Scope: world coastlines and optional OpenSeaMap sea marks use GTK's existing
  URLs and data locations. Startup offers missing data only when online and
  loading charts; downloads require an explicit click. HTTP failures, empty or
  truncated responses, invalid archives/paths and unreadable shapefile/OSM data
  are rejected before installation. Staging retains an existing installation
  until validated replacement and restores it after a failed final rename.
  Completed datasets remain available after later failure/cancellation. Settings
  may close during download; main-window close cancels and ignores late UI work.
  Installed coastlines replace the country fallback, enable routing land checks
  and refresh marine masks without restart. Existing chart objects/selection are
  retained, duplicate reloads avoided and incomplete base data can be repaired.
  Native filesystem pickers and GTK's existing download interface remain.
- Fidelity: no routing math, shoreline geometry/resolution, source ranking, units
  or portrayal change. Production shapefile and OSM readers validate downloads;
  the renderer receives the same installed paths. Only base-layer availability,
  failure handling and frontend setup change.
- Validation: full suite passes 822 tests and 106 subtests (86.26s), including the
  isolated wrapper with 78 Qt checks. Ten new core checks cover streamed/unknown
  length downloads, cancellation, HTTP errors, truncation, archive validation,
  all five coastline resolutions, OSM validation, old-data preservation, atomic
  rollback and partial completion. Five new Qt checks cover missing selection/
  startup gating, actual fixture installs and UI-thread attachment, fallback
  removal/routing providers, mask refresh, repair/idempotence, existing selection,
  serialized operations, cancel/close and partial-success error reporting. The
  strengthened repair/sea-mark-selection check also passes after the final
  completeness check. Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy (29 files) pass; full Flake8
  retains the existing connection-dialog C901 and full mypy retains 32 baseline
  errors in eight existing files (217 checked).
- Native QA: macOS Qt Map Data checked at 620×450 in a 1000×650 workspace with
  temporary model/workspace/map data and disabled settings writes. Missing and
  installed states, successful coastline attachment and clean close without GTK
  imports verified with widget captures. Both provider HEAD requests return
  HTTP 200 (141854687 and 2231114 bytes). Full live downloads were not performed;
  coastline tests use real small shapefiles and sea-mark tests use an OSM XML
  fixture read by the production OSM driver. Sphinx unavailable locally.
- Review follow-up: replace selection checkboxes and Download selected with
  Download World Coastlines and Download OpenSeaMap buttons. Remove explanatory
  copy and empty status; show progress/cancel only during acquisition. Installed
  datasets have disabled Installed buttons. Updated Qt integration wrapper,
  scoped Flake8/mypy and native macOS widget review pass.
- Settings menu follow-up: remove the workspace-header duplicate and assign
  the menu action an explicit native Preferences role with the standard shortcut.
  Qt app/display identity is GWeatherRouting; direct interpreter launches retain
  Python's bundle menu name until macOS packaging. Focused action/shortcut test,
  scoped Flake8/mypy and native menu inspection pass (Python → Settings…).
- Settings status follow-up: suppress generic idle Done text and confine useful
  connection-task feedback to the Connections tab. Existing connection/menu
  checks and direct empty/error/tab-visibility verification pass; scoped static
  checks pass.
- Intended upstream scope: shared acquisition/constants, resilient base-chart
  loading/reload and tests adapted against fresh parent master only if requested;
  exclude Qt frontend and fork policy/migration documentation.
- Usage/assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt map rebuild-frame presentation fix

- Status: fork-only Qt bug fix; no upstream submission.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-map-frame-presentation`, from `dev` at `15a1c06` in
  `/private/tmp/gwr-qt-map-frame-presentation`. Independent of pending Settings/
  map-data PR #20. The original checkout and its uncommitted diagnostic/other
  agent changes are preserved.
- Review: [fork PR #21](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/21),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `76f2c61`). User confirmed that
  panning/zooming in the isolated fixed app resolves the flashing. All builds,
  including macOS, and docs passed; CI failures match existing connection-dialog
  complexity, four type errors and missing `nmeatoolkit`; other test jobs were
  cancelled by fail-fast.
- Functional commit: `2cd04a9` adds the missing image blit and two pixel regression
  checks. The production fix is one line in `_draw_reusable_layer()`.
- Problem/result: commit `29ec449` introduced a rebuild branch that creates and
  caches an image but never draws it. Cache-hit branches draw correctly, so
  rebuilds present only sea plus direct-painted overlays; the following cache-hit
  frame restores chart/navigation pixels. This explains valid baked images and
  surviving caption/markers without a compositor or buffer-lifetime failure.
  Rebuilt layers now draw immediately at the current view's origin, retaining
  reuse, pan offsets and zoom previews. No repaint pacing, buffer pinning,
  approximation, sampling, chart/source ordering or routing changes.
- Validation: before the fix, two pixel tests fail in ten cases: helper DPR 1/2
  plus actual QWidget render at DPR 1/2 for cold, data-key, large-pan and settled-
  zoom rebuilds. The direct-painted marker is present while cached content is
  absent. After the single-line fix all cases pass. Full suite passes 812 tests
  and 101 subtests (82.86s), including 75 isolated Qt checks. Scoped Flake8 and
  mypy pass. Black passes the regression test file; the map file's two unrelated
  formatting differences reproduce unchanged on the base and were not mixed
  into this fix.
- Native verification: launched the fixed checkout under installed Qt 6.12.0 as
  “GWeatherRouting — map frame fix”, using installed chart data, offline instrument
  connections and a copied private workspace file. The user's original layout
  is not overwritten. Automated pixel tests establish the missing-draw defect;
  user confirmed the visible macOS navigation fix before approving merge.
  No new automated native screen-recording comparison is claimed.
- Integration: synchronized into active map-data PR #20 (merge `2caf29a`).
  All eight pre-existing modified files were restored and checked against a
  backup; their changes remain uncommitted. The rebuild-frame, native Settings
  action and map-data reload checks pass together (four focused checks).
  Independent diagnostic changes remain separate from this correction.
- Intended upstream scope: none while Qt remains fork-only.

## Qt live map motion preferences

- Status: candidate for the toolkit-neutral helper move; Qt integration and fork
  migration documentation remain fork-only pending an explicit upstream request.
  No upstream submission.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-map-motion-settings` from `dev` at `fd5517f`, including
  the approved/visually confirmed map rebuild fix PR #21. Independent of open
  Settings/map-data PR #20; no pending prerequisite or retargeting.
- Review: [fork PR #22](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/22),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `f05feb3`). The user tested the
  combined preview and confirmed smooth interaction. Docs CI passed; the linter
  failure is the existing connection-dialog C901. Other CI jobs were pending
  at merge time.
- Functional commits: `fda2c25` moves existing pure motion helpers into Core and
  preserves GTK import compatibility; `7328711` binds live Qt preferences,
  drag inertia, gesture/lifecycle cancellation and motion-aware workspace save.
- Scope: Smooth zoom on retains the existing Qt wheel easing; off applies each
  wheel step immediately. Toggling off during animation finishes at the requested
  cursor-anchored target. Pan inertia on uses GTK's release velocity sampling,
  speed cap, pause suppression and decay; off stops at drag release or immediately
  cancels an active glide. Preferences apply to both Charts and Logs and persist
  through the existing Settings model. New input, fit, placement, hide, resize and
  close stop inertia. Deferred overlay updates settle once motion ends; workspace
  autosave waits for either map's drag, zoom or inertia to stop. The confirmed
  missing-blit correction remains intact; no diagnostic pacing/pinning is added.
- Fidelity: helper math is unchanged and GTK callers retain their old imports.
  Qt retains its prior wheel step, easing, pointer anchor and latitude/zoom limits.
  No routing calculation, chart geometry, source selection or sampling changes.
  A formatter also normalizes two pre-existing expressions in the touched canvas.
- Validation: final full suite passes 812 tests and 101 subtests (85.81s), including
  81 isolated Qt checks. Six new checks cover immediate/animated anchor behavior,
  mid-zoom disable, inertia direction/decay/live stop, held-release suppression,
  timer completion/new input/fit/placement/hide/resize/close cancellation,
  preference callbacks in both views, private-file restart and deferred overlays/
  workspace save. Existing GTK motion checks pass unchanged. Initial full run had
  three GTK docking failures; all three reproduced on unchanged `dev` in the same
  environment. They pass in the final full rerun. Scoped Black/Flake8/mypy pass
  (four production files); full Flake8 retains the existing connection-dialog C901
  and full mypy retains 32 baseline errors in eight files (216 checked).
- Combined/native QA: a temporary detached checkout based on PR #20 with the two
  functional commits applied passes its Qt wrapper (87 checks). Native macOS Qt
  6.12.0 at DPR 2 verifies immediate/animated zoom, released-drag continuation and
  live stop through Display checkboxes; native Settings widget capture inspected.
  “GWeatherRouting — motion settings preview” is running from that combined
  checkout with installed charts and private copied settings/workspace JSON plus
  offline connections. Original settings/layout and the main checkout are intact.
  No new live hardware/provider or screen-recording validation is claimed.
- Limits: native pinch/trackpad scroll-to-pan parity, dateline/pole behavior and
  packaging remain separate work. PR #20 stays open for review.
- Intended upstream scope: pure helper module relocation and GTK compatibility
  imports if requested; exclude Qt code, fork policy and migration documentation.
- Usage/assessment: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.


## Qt offscreen map coverage

- Status: fork-only; no upstream submission.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-map-overscan` from `dev` at `9e8401e`, following merged
  motion PR #22 and the verified rebuild-frame fix. Independent of open Map Data
  PR #20; neither is a pending prerequisite for the other.
- Review: [fork PR #23](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/23),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `4b1a47d`). The user tested the
  preview and approved integration. Docs CI passed; CI typecheck reports four
  pre-existing errors in untouched NMEA2000/GTK connection settings files. Other
  CI jobs were pending at merge time.
- Functional commits: `2d2867d` adds bounded padded scene bakes and safe coverage
  reuse plus CHS attribution bounds; `71ef4e8` clips map paints; `765da0c` samples
  only visible pixels and adds an ancestor-surface pixel regression.
- Behavior/fidelity: Charts and Logs bake up to 192 logical pixels beyond each
  edge, bounded by 16 MiB extra image storage per cached layer. Projection
  expansion is synchronous and restored in `finally`; async workers capture
  frozen viewports while retaining canvas identity. Pan rebuilds leave a safety
  margin. Animated zoom reuse requires full viewport coverage; exhaustion builds
  and draws a replacement in the same paint and permits fresh chart/overlay jobs.
  Routing calculations, source selection, chart geometry and zoom anchors are
  unchanged. Existing backend worker queues/cancellation remain in use.
- Validation: full unittest discovery passes 750 tests in 88.4s, including 83 Qt
  checks before the presentation follow-ups. Final combined PR #20 preview passes
  90 Qt checks in 42.8s (84 from this branch plus six Map Data/Settings checks).
  New DPR 1/2 pixel checks cover an offscreen landmark entering view, pan/zoom
  reuse, safe pan and large zoom-out rebuilds, and confinement to an ancestor
  image's map rectangle. Budget and failed-reader restoration checks pass; the
  shared CHS test verifies attribution translation and Cairo state restoration.
  The previous missing-blit regressions pass. Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy with
  silent imports pass; normal scoped mypy's nine imported-module errors reproduce
  unchanged on dev. An initial combined Qt/GTK test invocation failed the Qt
  import-isolation assertion; proper full discovery uses the isolated wrapper
  and passes.
- Measurement: local offscreen bundled-world-chart fixture at 1100×700 logical
  pixels/DPR 2: ten measured sharp bakes after two warmups have medians 12.1ms
  without padding and 17.4ms padded; 100 image reuses have median 1.6ms. Base image
  storage grows from 11.75 to 24.55 MiB. Earlier run measured 10.4/13.7ms;
  these are local fixture results, not a provider/native-compositor guarantee.
  Image budget excludes existing renderer caches and temporary Cairo/copy buffers.
- Native QA: Qt 6.12/DPR 2 confirms padded base/navigation sizes, small pan and
  zoom reuse, and large zoom-out replacement. The running “GWeatherRouting —
  padded map preview” includes PR #20 in a detached temporary worktree with
  private copied settings/workspace JSON, installed charts and offline instrument
  connections. Native QWidget window captures have toolbar background corruption
  that also reproduces on the unchanged motion preview; no new spill regression
  or screen-recording comparison is claimed. User approved the tested preview.
- Limits: asynchronous providers still load unavailable chart/weather coverage;
  no lower-detail zoom backdrop, native gesture migration or packaging changes.
- Intended upstream scope: none while Qt remains fork-only.
- Documentation: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt native trackpad gestures

- Status: fork-only; no upstream submission.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-native-map-gestures` from `dev` at `39e391d`, after
  approved Map Data/Settings PR #20, motion PR #22 and padded coverage PR #23.
  All previously open fork PRs are merged; no pending dependency or merge order.
- Review: [fork PR #24](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/24),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `503abeb`). Build and docs CI
  passed. CI tests failed during collection because `nmeatoolkit` is absent;
  sibling test jobs were cancelled. Lint retains the untouched connection-dialog
  C901 and typecheck retains four errors in untouched NMEA2000/GTK connection
  settings files. Local full-suite results remain as recorded below.
- Functional commit: `5106288` implements native gesture dispatch, direct anchored
  pinch scaling, macOS precise scroll/pan and native momentum, interruption and
  shared motion-state checks for overlay deferral/workspace autosave.
- Scope/fidelity: Qt native pinch applies `log2(1 + event.value())` to Mercator
  zoom, preserving the initial geographic anchor and existing 1–20 limits.
  Mouse-wheel easing remains controlled by Smooth zoom; pinch follows fingers
  directly. Rotation/compatibility scroll during a pinch does not double zoom.
  macOS unmodified pixel scrolling moves both axes with Qt's natural-scroll
  deltas and native momentum, without a second drag-inertia animation. Ordinary
  wheels, Control/Command-modified scroll and non-macOS wheel behavior retain
  zoom. Chart geometry, source selection and routing calculations are unchanged.
- Lifecycle: native begin/end and scroll phases defer overlay refresh and saves;
  unphased scrolling settles after 250ms idle. Fit, placement, new drag, hide,
  resize, window deactivation and close clear gesture state and timers. Both
  Charts and Logs use the same behavior. Prior rebuilt-frame/padded-coverage
  regression checks remain in the passing suite.
- Validation: full unittest discovery passes 760 tests in 92.8s, including 96
  isolated Qt checks. Six added checks send real QNativeGestureEvent and
  QWheelEvent objects through Qt, covering both maps, incremental scaling and
  anchors, limits/invalid scale, compatibility/rotation suppression, two-axis
  pan/momentum, natural deltas, modifiers, ordinary wheel and platform fallback,
  deferred overlays/workspace saves, idle fallback and lifecycle interruption.
  Scoped Black/Flake8 and mypy with silent imports pass (two production files).
- Native verification: Qt 6.12 at DPR 2 dispatches native pinch/scroll events in
  both views and verifies anchor preservation, unchanged zoom while panning,
  native momentum, no added drag inertia and settled state. A native preview
  used installed charts, offline connections and private copied settings/layout
  JSON. Physical trackpad input/feel and other-platform delivery remain for human
  review; event injection does not establish hardware/OS event delivery.
- References: Qt native gesture documentation specifies incremental scale deltas;
  wheel documentation specifies pixel displacement, natural inversion and
  begin/end/momentum phases. Links are in `docs/qt-first-pass.md`.
- Limits/next: no touchscreen gesture recognizer, rotation or smart/double-tap
  zoom. About/app identity, bundles/default launcher and final platform/live
  hardware parity checks remain separate migration work.
- Intended upstream scope: none while Qt remains fork-only.
- Documentation: `docs/qt-first-pass.md`, `docs/qt-parity.md`.

## Qt default launcher and migration validation

- Status: fork-only default/validation policy. The independent serial correction
  is a candidate described below; no upstream submission.
- Branch/base: `feature/qt-default-launcher` from `dev` at `b323e76`, following
  approved native gesture PR #24. No pending prerequisite.
- Review: [fork PR #25](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/25),
  merged into `dev` with user approval (merge `bf7c802`). Requested scope:
  default launcher and migration validation;
  app identity/Qt bundles and unrelated legacy lint/type cleanup are excluded.
- Functional commits: `2fc1842` switches source/installed launchers to Qt, declares
  PySide6 as a base dependency and Python 3.10+, retains Qt compatibility aliases
  and explicit GTK commands, and preserves existing GTK-only bundle entrypoints;
  `3b975d1` adds real TCP/UDP/serial and large-file regressions plus dedicated
  Linux/macOS/Windows Qt workflow jobs. The Python 3.9 CI matrix entries are
  removed to match the default application's supported runtime.
- Validation: editable install regenerated the commands and metadata; the actual
  installed default command opened native Qt 6.12/DPR 2, honored offline mode and
  imported no GTK, using private copied settings/layout. Full pytest passes 826
  tests and 106 subtests in 99.36s, including 99 isolated Qt checks. A subsequent
  test-only refinement tolerates expected socket-close errors after polling has
  stopped; the focused TCP/UDP test passes again. Scoped production Black,
  Flake8 and mypy with silent imports pass; changed YAML parses and the AppImage
  shell recipe passes syntax checking. Remote cross-platform jobs are pending
  and not claimed as successful native validation.
- Fidelity/performance: routing math, source selection and projection are
  unchanged. Complete map/plot data survives 30,000-point regression playback.
  Separate 100,000-RMC/4.96 MiB run: 3.30s asynchronous load/presentation, 0.42ms
  mean cursor update, 446 MiB peak process RSS and about 601ms maximum event-loop
  gap. The one-million-sentence playback cap and polar history bound remain.
- Findings/limits: dateline fitting at ±179.8° still frames almost the world
  (zoom 1.58); no dateline correctness claim or projection change. Large-file
  presentation can still pause the UI. No confirmed physical instrument hardware
  was used; software transport paths use fresh local sockets/pseudo-terminals.
  Native Windows/Linux gestures/dialogs, actual onboard streams and real provider
  downloads remain explicit open checks. Existing GTK bundle recipes stay GTK
  until their separate Qt packaging work. Detailed report:
  `docs/qt-default-validation.md`.
- Intended upstream scope: exclude default Qt policy, fork docs/CI and legacy
  bundle selection changes; consider only the independently validated serial fix.

- Merge verification: the main checkout is back on `dev`; the installed
  `gweatherrouting --help` resolves the Qt CLI. Build/docs CI passed on the
  previous head. Windows Qt validation reached import and found a missing QtSvg
  DLL; follow-up `8e16abd` adds the MSYS2 Qt SVG runtime. Its revalidation and
  Linux/macOS Qt jobs are not yet claimed as passing. Legacy tests still lack
  nmeatoolkit and legacy lint/type failures remain separate.

## Serial sentence fragmentation correction

- Status: candidate; no upstream submission or discussion.
- Review: included as a separate functional commit in
  [fork PR #25](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/25).
- Functional commit: `20b8c5a`; no dependency on Qt launcher policy.
- Trigger/result: serial drivers can return part of an NMEA sentence. Previously
  the reader immediately split the chunk and exposed a partial sentence to the
  parser, which could accept incomplete fields. The reader now retains partial
  input until CR/LF, handles CR/LF/CRLF, bounds unterminated/corrupt lines at 4096
  characters, and drops partial data on close/reconnect. Numeric interpretation
  and complete-sentence contents are unchanged; both frontends share this fix.
- Validation: the regression fails on the base, demonstrating premature packet
  delivery, and passes after the fix. Line-ending/bounds/reset checks and all 55
  connection tests pass, as does a real serial pseudo-terminal through Qt/Core.
  The complete local pytest suite passes as recorded above.
- Intended upstream scope: serialdatasource.py and its focused shared-reader
  regressions, extracted from freshly fetched parent master and validated there.

## Qt routing panel cleanup

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #26](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/26)
  on `feature/routing-panel-cleanup`, based on `dev` at `75c08f2`.
- Functional commit: `ae5d261` (Simplify Qt routing setup and remove duplicate
  Results tab).
- Scope: remove Manage polars, manual coordinate inputs, the duplicate boat
  button, and Results. Plans use waypoint tracks, boat position, saved POIs,
  or map-selected points; no hard-coded coordinates are silently selected.
  Navigation Routes owns saved-route selection, summaries, and point tables.
  Calculations still save/select/fit routes while retaining the planning tab.
  Route selection persists by name; old Results/Compare/Currents tab indices
  migrate correctly and new preferences save tab names.
- Dependencies: existing Qt routing/navigation on `dev`; independent of pending
  Weather panel and interpolation work. No prerequisite fork PR or retargeting.
- Validation: panel cleanup passes 101 Qt checks. Final branch passes 826 pytest
  tests and 106 subtests, including isolated Qt integration. Black, changed-file
  Flake8, and whitespace checks pass. Repository-wide Flake8 has one existing
  complexity diagnostic; mypy has 32 existing diagnostics in 8 unchanged files.
  Both sets were reproduced on a clean archive of the same `dev` base.
- Intended upstream scope: Qt panel/navigation wiring, workspace migration,
  and focused UI regressions. Extract independently against parent `master`;
  exclude this fork contribution record. Upstream submission is not authorized.

## Live Qt routing isochrones

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #26](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/26).
- Functional commit: `c04f62f` (Display live routing isochrones in the Qt map).
- Problem/result: progress previously carried only the best path. It now carries
  frozen frontier coordinates alongside its path-compatible tuple and reuses
  completed snapshots. Qt renders actual bands through a shared background
  Cairo layer and retains the selected saved route's bands after completion.
  New scenarios/cancellation clear bands and stale progress cannot revive them.
  Compatible in-flight renders finish while only the latest update is queued.
  Sparse frontier points remain visible; joins retain the existing 3 km limit.
  Routing algorithms and calculated results are unchanged.
- Dependencies: follows panel cleanup `ae5d261` for Navigation route selection
  wiring in this fork PR; upstream adaptation can use the parent's selection
  wiring. Extracts the GTK renderer into the shared rendering package, preserving
  GTK imports. Overlay lifecycle hooks also support pending weather work, which
  is excluded from this PR.
- Validation: final branch passes 826 pytest tests and 106 subtests. Regressions
  verify engine-result equivalence, rendered live pixels before completion,
  rendering off the UI thread, cancellation, and saved-route band selection.
  Formatting/lint/type-check results and clean-base comparisons are recorded in
  the panel cleanup entry above.
- Intended upstream scope: progress snapshots, shared renderer/lifecycle, Qt
  integration, and focused regressions. Extract and validate against freshly
  fetched parent `master`; exclude this fork contribution record. Upstream
  submission is a separate task.

## Weather panel and continuous GRIB sampling

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #27](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/27),
  `feature/weather-integration`, based on `dev` after routing PR #26.
- Functional commits: `4de7ca5`, `f859ab0`, `fe17785`. Toolbar hover/pressed/checked
  styles and disabled-icon colors were restored after combined-app review; Black,
  Flake8, and visual rendering checks pass. The original uncommitted
  `feature/weather-panel` working tree is preserved; this isolated integration
  branch carries its weather changes reconciled with current routing.
- Scope: dedicated Weather dock, independent wind/isobar controls, configurable
  isobar spacing/opacity/labels, and live scrubber updates. Display/cursor and
  scalar/batched routing share model/run-aware bilinear and temporal sampling.
  Different model runs/members are not blended. Pixel-center correction and
  continuous time sampling intentionally change numerical results.
- Validation: 857 tests and 106 subtests pass on the weather branch. The combined
  four-feature branch passes 903 tests and 110 subtests. Analytical missing-value,
  source-selection, spatial/time interpolation, and consumer-agreement tests pass.
  Weather/routing panel screenshots were rendered and visually inspected.
- Performance: the recorded local warm-query benchmark measured 0.23 ms median
  versus 0.43 ms on the previous sampler; cold indexing was 53 ms versus 15 ms.
  No spatial downsampling or interpolation of direction angles was introduced.
- Intended upstream scope: shared sampling, scrubber/overlay scheduling, and
  Weather UI as focused contributions; exclude fork tracking. Regional vector
  handling is a separate dependent contribution below. No upstream submission
  has been authorized.

## Regional HRRR and HRDPS wind integration

- Status: queued on shared-sampling dependency; fork review
  [PR #28](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/28),
  `feature/pnw-wind-integration`, based on PR #27's branch.
- Functional commits: `7c2c198` (adapted original `4716356`), `9ee31ee`.
  The `feature/pnw-wind` prototype remains preserved.
- Scope: registered HRRR/HRDPS sources reach the Qt downloader; HRRR bounds and
  MSLMA pressure are supported. Read per-field GRIB2 vector-reference flags and
  rotate grid-relative components at native sample centers before spatial/time
  blending. Handle HRDPS rotated geographic CRS. Unsupported vector templates
  are unavailable, not silently interpreted as east/north. Automatic gap recovery
  remains GFS; legacy GRIB1 retains its prior vector-reference assumption.
- Validation: 870 backend tests and 106 subtests pass; the complete 105-test Qt
  suite passes after fixing the new test's initial-library-scan race. Combined
  four-feature validation passes 903 tests and 110 subtests. Analytical Lambert
  convergence, rotated coordinates, and GRIB2 concatenation/submessages are covered.
  Actual 2026-10-15 12Z HRRR and HRDPS files declare grid-relative winds; scalar
  and batch vectors agree after rotation and regional node extraction succeeds.
- Merge order: merge PR #27 first, retarget this PR to `dev`, then verify its
  focused diff/checks. Independent of WCOFS and safety integration after #27.
- Intended upstream scope: provider/download UI integration and native vector
  interpretation, extracted after shared sampling support. No upstream publication.

## WCOFS coastal-current integration

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #29](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/29),
  `feature/wcofs-integration`, based on PR #27's branch.
- Functional commits: `19b5190` (adapted original `ea2fd90`), `4adf55a`,
  `ce864a7`, `e0864db`. The `feature/nos-currents` prototype remains preserved.
- Scope: NOAA OPeNDAP coverage discovery, ROMS destaggering/rotation, and regular
  current-field integration. Preserve NetCDF/face/land masks, reject mixed wet/dry
  cells, require a bracketing run, and retain missing-hour gaps. Cache spatial
  cell locations per download. Record static and hourly decoded-array hashes.
  The 0.04-degree output resampling is explicit; no extra coastal resolution is
  claimed. Full model current includes tides and is selected, not added to other
  models' tidal currents.
- Validation: 873 tests and 106 subtests pass; final provider/coverage checks pass.
  The combined four-feature branch passes 903 tests and 110 subtests. After the
  binary-reader follow-up, all 43 focused launcher/provider/field checks pass.
  A live NOAA 2026-10-15 04–05Z subset returned a 2×6×6 field with 72 finite
  samples, maximum speed 0.412 m/s, and three source records.
- Dependencies/platforms: netCDF4 is included in normal installation and tox.
  Minimal `--no-deps` installs remain able to start without it and report WCOFS
  unavailable. MSYS2 WCOFS downloads are not yet validated; no successful Windows
  WCOFS run is claimed. Existing marine current-field interfaces are prerequisites.
- Merge order: PR #27 first, then retarget to `dev`; independent of #28/#30.
- Intended upstream scope: provider, ROMS transforms, coverage integration,
  dependency handling, and tests, validated against the applicable marine base.

## Routing safety controls and policy integration

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #30](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/30),
  `feature/routing-safety-integration`, based on PR #27's branch.
- Functional commits: `fc818fa` (adapted original `20b52b3`), `50d4486`,
  `30b2676`. The `feature/edge-safety` prototype remains preserved.
- Scope: optional persisted maximum wind, sailing-speed threshold/motor fallback,
  and explicitly labeled wind-based wave proxy in Routing Plan. Requests/scenarios
  freeze inputs and save policy provenance. Reject capped candidates in wind-only
  and current scalar/batch/frontier paths. Avoid stationary wind-only candidates
  waiting through capped wind. Defaults remain inert; invalid thresholds fail.
- Numerical policy: polar efficiency precedes speed adjustments. The proxy
  reduces sailing speed above 20 kn, up to 25% at 40 kn. Motoring replaces adjusted
  speeds below the threshold and remains subject to caps. No actual wave/gust
  forecasts or fuel/endurance model is implemented; existing integration sample
  positions/times define where caps are checked.
- Validation: initial full branch passes 872 tests and 110 subtests. Final focused
  safety/routing checks pass 20 tests and 4 subtests. Scalar/whole-frontier parity,
  wind-only rejection, immutable UI requests, and workspace persistence are covered.
  Combined four-feature suite passes 903 tests and 110 subtests.
- Merge order: PR #27 first, then retarget to `dev`; independent of #28/#29.
- Intended upstream scope: reusable policy, engine integration, Qt controls and
  persistence, and focused regressions; no upstream submission authorized.

### Combined integration review checks

- All four were assembled locally on `feature/weather-routing-validation` without
  merging any new feature into `dev`. The full combined suite passed twice at
  903 tests and 110 subtests; the subsequent WCOFS binary-reader follow-up passed
  43 focused tests. Numerical code is shared with the focused review branches.
- Changed production code passes Black/Flake8 and whitespace checks. Full Flake8
  retains the pre-existing connection-dialog complexity failure. Full mypy retains
  exactly the same 32 errors in 8 unchanged files as a clean archive of `dev`.
- CI results are separate from local validation and may still be queued/running.
  Fork PRs remain unmerged pending user approval. No upstream PR was created.

## Forecasts library layout and automatic discovery

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #31](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/31),
  `feature/forecast-library`, based on `feature/pnw-wind-integration` (PR #28),
  which depends on Weather PR #27. Functional commit: `d424580`.
- Scope: show model identity separately from run time; put Import beside the
  Local wind forecasts heading; remove coordinate inputs and Refresh/Remove copy
  buttons. GFS/HRRR downloads use the active chart/log map view; HRDPS remains
  full-domain. Date-line-crossing download views retain the prior unsupported-area
  restriction and show a message rather than selecting a different area.
- Automatic discovery: scan when Forecasts opens and watch directory/file
  changes while visible. Defer scans during active operations, stop retrying when
  hidden, and restore selection by file path after updates. Newly discovered files
  are listed without automatically enabling them. Context removal preserves its
  selected metadata target if the list changes and explains deletion of the
  library copy while retaining the original import.
- Model names: identify GFS/HRRR from GRIB metadata and HRDPS with an additional
  grid check. Unknown models remain explicitly Unknown. Display labels use a
  separate attribute and do not alter numerical sampler identity/selection.
- Validation: 872 tests and 106 subtests pass on the feature branch. All 108 Qt
  integration checks pass with Weather, PNW wind, WCOFS, safety, and live
  isochrones combined. Focused tests cover file addition/edit/deletion, stable
  selection, hide/reopen, context targets, active map bounds, and model metadata.
  Real HRRR/HRDPS files show correct labels. Forecasts screenshot was visually
  inspected; Black, changed production-file Flake8, and whitespace checks pass.
  Scoped mypy retains only existing diagnostics in unchanged dependencies.
- Merge order: after PR #27/#28 merge, retarget this PR to `dev` and recheck its
  focused diff. WCOFS/safety PRs are independent. The local combined validation
  branch includes this change for testing; no new feature was merged into dev.
- Intended upstream scope: GRIB display metadata and Qt library layout/lifecycle
  with focused regressions, after applicable Qt/provider prerequisites. Exclude
  this fork tracking record. No upstream submission is authorized.

## Custom GRIB download selections

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #32](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/32),
  `feature/custom-forecast-downloads`, based on Forecast Library PR #31,
  which depends on PNW wind PR #28 and Weather PR #27.
- Functional commits: `109f34b` and `6c1e47f`.
- Scope: Expedition-style model/parameter/forecast-hour controls for GFS, HRRR
  and HRDPS. Select duration, native or fixed spacing, and explicit hours;
  list actual per-run coverage and approximate sizes; check and download multiple
  runs. Show model resolution and forecast length in columns, omit explanatory
  paragraphs, and retain automatic local discovery. OpenSkiron is temporarily
  disabled in the provider registry and its source dropdown is removed.
  Batch staging/validation retains successful downloads if another model fails,
  enables files on the UI thread, and retains the result through automatic scans.
- Provider behavior: custom GFS allows hourly output through hour 120 then
  three-hour output; legacy presets and routing-recovery schedules remain
  unchanged. HRRR respects 18/48-hour run limits. HRDPS retains full-domain
  requests, hourly wind and three-hour pressure. Only implemented wind/pressure
  fields are exposed. Model/run interpolation and routing selection are unchanged;
  no ensemble routing or cross-model blending is added.
- Validation: feature suite passed 878 tests and 110 subtests before the final
  hourly-GFS/scan-feedback follow-ups; final provider checks passed 32 tests and
  4 subtests and focused Qt checks passed. A live NOAA pressure-only request
  decoded exactly forecast hours 0 and 1. Visually inspected the dialog with
  real HRRR/HRDPS files and multiple checked model runs. Black, changed production
  Flake8 and whitespace checks pass. Full mypy matches the clean dev baseline
  exactly (32 errors in 8 unchanged files). The final combined build passes
  912 tests and 114 subtests, including the final follow-ups, with Weather,
  PNW wind, WCOFS, safety, local-library cleanup and live isochrones together.
- Follow-up validation: all 109 Qt checks pass after provider disablement and
  layout cleanup; the revised dialog was visually inspected. Black, changed-file
  Flake8 and whitespace checks pass.
- Merge order: PR #27, #28, #31, then retarget #32 to `dev` and recheck its diff
  and checks. WCOFS PR #29 and safety PR #30 are independent. The combined local
  validation branch includes this feature; none of these review PRs was merged.
- Intended upstream scope: custom-selection helpers, provider support, Qt controls
  and regressions after applicable Qt/provider prerequisites. Exclude fork
  tracking and the fork-specific temporary OpenSkiron disablement. No upstream
  submission is authorized.

## Model-based weather selection and routing downloads

- Status: candidate; fork review [PR #33](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/33),
  `feature/model-weather-selection`, based on custom forecast downloads PR #32,
  which depends on library PR #31, PNW wind PR #28 and Weather PR #27.
- Functional commit: `15235ea`.
- Scope: persistent model checkboxes replace separate local-file enablement and
  remote-file selection in the main Forecasts view. One button downloads the
  latest available run for each checked provider. Files/import/removal remain in
  a secondary window with read-only usage indicators. Recognized imports select
  their model; unrecognized models have an Imported checkbox without a download
  provider. Checkbox changes preserve cached files and reload eligible readers.
- Routing: freeze model/field/hour selections; reuse covering caches and fetch
  checked models for route coverage in both wind-only and current-aware modes.
  Exclude unchecked models even if their runs are newer; never substitute an
  unchecked GFS model after a regional failure. Routing requests required 10 m
  wind. Respect run horizons, stage/validate unique atomic files, and pass frozen
  metadata to independent UI readers. Record selected models and download issues.
- Sampling policy: continue shared spatial/time interpolation and newest-run
  selection; preserve existing file precedence on scans. No ensemble routing
  or cross-model blending is added. Cached wind-only route points/isochrones
  match legacy calculation exactly. Routing checks actual query locations/times.
- View feedback: panning does not download or alter selection. A debounced
  bottom-right notice screens a 3-by-3 view sample for per-model wind/pressure
  availability at the forecast time. This is a preview, not exhaustive coverage
  proof; reads use private background handles. Batch model downloads preserve
  scrubber time; explicit imports retain their prior time jump.
- Validation: final combined suite passes 922 tests and 114 subtests with all
  active Weather/PNW/WCOFS/safety/library/live-isochrone work. Feature suite
  passed 888 tests/110 subtests before final follow-ups; focused core and Qt
  follow-ups pass and are included in the final combined result. Coverage spans
  persisted selection, cache reuse/retention, automatic wind-only bootstrap,
  private UI/worker readers, exclusion of unchecked newer sources in both
  engines, horizon selection, and view/time/field notices. Live NOAA download
  decoded only selected GFS pressure hours 0 and 3. Visually inspected the dialog
  and notice with real HRRR/HRDPS files. Changed production Black/Flake8 and
  whitespace checks pass; combined mypy exactly matches clean dev's existing
  32 errors in 8 unchanged files.
- Integration: local `feature/weather-routing-validation` includes this feature;
  its RouteRequest merge retained both safety fields and forecast selection.
  Review PRs remain unmerged. Merge #27/#28/#31/#32 first, then retarget #33 to
  `dev` and recheck its diff/checks. WCOFS #29 and safety #30 remain independent.
- Intended upstream scope: reusable model selection/download recovery, followed
  by the Qt workflow/coverage notice after applicable provider/frontend
  prerequisites. Extract focused contributions independently; exclude this fork
  tracking. No upstream submission is authorized.
