"""The viewport's chart layer: an independent generation of chart imagery.

The chart layer is the *application's* chart composition, not a second one.
The base chart is composed by ``BaseChartRenderer`` -- the application's own
worker-side composition with private GDAL handles, the application's chart
drawers and the application's palette -- the installed and enabled ENC cells
are composed by the application's own ``ENCOverlayRenderer`` on the same
cairo surface, and the mean-sea-level pressure contours are the
application's own ``WindPainter.draw_isobars`` on that same surface.  No
chart portrayal is re-implemented here.

The order is the application's own: the base chart first, the ENC second and
the pressure contours last, so the ENC sits under the contours exactly as it
sits under them in the application.

What the layer adds is the viewport's *generation*.  The chart composition is
its own pipeline with its own worker thread, its own state and its own cancel
event:

* the weather is presented before the chart layer is ready, and the chart
  layer never waits for the weather to be presented to begin;
* a superseded chart generation is cancelled and can never publish, exactly
  as the field pipeline guarantees for fields;
* the chart layer never claims the field worker: it waits for the weather
  pipeline to be idle before it composes, so the chart can never delay the
  weather;
* the chart layer's composition is retained while it still covers the
  camera, using the application's own ``fits`` rule, so a small pan does not
  recompose the chart;
* the composition is composed at the GUI's own device pixel ratio, and a
  zoom or a ratio change is composed again rather than resampled.

The ENC cells are the application's own cells: the installed and enabled
entries of the user's manifest, read and opened by this layer's own worker
with its own handles.  The ENC source reports its own states -- ``ready``,
``coverage_miss``, ``unavailable`` -- so a missing cell is never presented
as an empty chart that reads as "there is no data here".
