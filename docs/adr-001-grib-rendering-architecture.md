# ADR-001: GRIB rendering architecture — reconciliation and decisions

- **Status:** Accepted. D2 was decided on 2026-10-19 in favour of option (a); the
  amendment is applied in §6. D6 (target interaction path) was decided on
  2026-10-19 in §4.6. D7 records the user's direction to use the viewport in the
  normal application; D8 records the decision to retire the old map without CPU
  recovery. The #70 keep-experimental evidence remains recorded, but those later
  user directions supersede its rollout recommendation.
- **Date:** 2026-10-19
- **Supersedes:** nothing. **Amends:** [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md)
  (the R0–R5 sequence and the invariants at lines 43–70), as recorded in §6.
- **Related epic:** [#51](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/51)

This ADR is **not** a new architecture. The target architecture already exists in
[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) — see "Architecture
and ownership" (lines 71–123) and the R0–R5 implementation sequence (lines 130–266).
This document reconciles that specification with the 2026-10-19 current-state analysis and
the reference-technique analysis, records the resulting decisions, and maps them to
executable issues. It deliberately does **not** restate the specification; it links to it.

## Current checkpoint

**ENC application rollout direction (after #80):** the user authorized enabling
the completed ENC worker in the normal application viewport, retaining legacy
recovery, without a pixel-for-pixel legacy matching requirement. The bounded
implementation/acceptance contract is [enc-default-rollout.md](enc-default-rollout.md).
This revises the default-off direction for this ENC slice only, subject to its
application-level functional gate. That gate subsequently passed 13/13 on the
verified fixture (current pan/zoom/resize/time views and legacy recovery), with
140 targeted passes and one known base failure; see the rollout evidence.
It does not declare the #70 platform/soak or
presentation-latency program complete and does not change numerical sampling.

- **Canonical current state and invariants:**
  [`rendering-performance-plan.md`](rendering-performance-plan.md) — start at its
  "Current state". The archived decision log is in
  [`history/rendering-decision-log.md`](history/rendering-decision-log.md).
  This ADR is the decision input to that roadmap.
- **Implementation program:** epic #51, issues
  [#62–#70](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/62); the
  local index is [`milestones.md`](milestones.md). One issue at a time; each
  states its own gate, evidence and validation command.
- **R0–R5 implementation detail, invariants and measurement contract:**
  [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md), as
  amended by §6 below.
- **Experiment record:** the A0a–A0l slices in
  [`rendering-architecture-evaluation.md`](history/rendering-architecture-evaluation.md)
  and in the archived
  [`decision log`](history/rendering-decision-log.md); the M0 mechanism probes
  in the `rendering-m0-*.md` records and in
  [`history/rendering-experiment-records.md`](history/rendering-experiment-records.md);
  machine-readable evidence under `docs/profiles/rendering/`.
- **Status:** D1–D6 are settled. D7's application integration was delivered by
  PR #91; D8's legacy-map retirement is in progress under #86. §10 requires
  explicit user forecast selection in the Weather panel. Fidelity/performance
  acceptance remains incomplete. No new A0 slice is authorized.
- **Wider documentation map:** [the documentation index](README.md).

## 1. Context

### 1.1 What the analyses established

| Analysis | Result |
| --- | --- |
| [`grib-architecture-analysis.md`](grib-architecture-analysis.md) | Current-state architecture with file/line citations, and the structural gaps listed in §3. |
| [`luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md`](luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md) | Reference techniques T1–T8 with explicit evidence labels and coverage limits. |

Two conclusions from the reference analysis materially shape this ADR:

1. **The reference implementation performs spatial interpolation on the CPU** (T6), not on
   the GPU. GPU spatial interpolation (D2) is therefore an advance *beyond* the reference,
   not parity work, and must never be justified as "the reference does it this way."
2. **The reference was not observed to have a unified residency budget or eviction**
   (T7). Our D1 therefore extends, rather than mirrors.

Four of the seven gaps have a direct reference analogue (T1/T4 async structure, T2 tiled
storage, T3 retained scene graph, T5 animation-state time switching). Three do not
(GPU spatial interpolation, unified GPU budget, cache-key coherence) and are places where
we can exceed the reference.

### 1.2 What the existing specification already settles

These are **not** re-decided here. Citing them so that no agent reopens them.

| Settled | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Host: mouse-transparent `QQuickWidget` for base/navigation/wind, sibling `QWidget` for route/track/AIS/dashboard | [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) line 12 and following. R0.2 is effectively discharged. |
| A resource ledger with explicit trial limits (512 MiB estimated GPU storage, 128 MiB CPU scene snapshots, 128 MiB upload payload) | [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) lines 24–26. R5 is partially discharged. |
| Layer/ownership model: `ViewState`, `ContentKey`, `LayerFrame`, UI/worker boundary, GPU boundary, publication generation rejection | [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 77–120. |
| Non-negotiable invariants (sampling, masks, interpolation, source ordering, fallback, density, glyph geometry, CPU fallback retained) | [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 56–70. |
| Measurement contract and required acceptance evidence per area | [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 267–292. |
| Program-level CPU-vs-GPU matched baseline (stationary p99 51.8→11.0 ms, pan 90.7→54.2 ms, zoom out 98.3→70.3 ms) | [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) lines 44–46. **Readback timings, not presentation.** |

---

## 2. Scope of this ADR

**In scope:** layer boundaries, ownership, data representations, scheduling model, and
the disposition of the seven structural gaps.

**Explicitly out of scope (unchanged non-negotiables):** routing calculations, source
selection and ordering, weather value fidelity, portrayal density/thinning/geometry,
the CPU fallback path, the GTK frontend, network acquisition policy, and user-data
mutation. These remain as stated in
[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 56–70.

---

## 3. Structural gaps and disposition

The seven gaps, as named in [`grib-architecture-analysis.md`](grib-architecture-analysis.md):

| # | Gap | Disposition | Decision | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Decode location: CPU (GDAL → NumPy) | **Deferred** | D5 | — |
| G2 | Data residency: CPU-side caches, no GPU-resident field | **Closed** | D1 | [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64) |
| G3 | Spatial interpolation: CPU Python loops | **Closed** | D2 | [#65](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/65) |
| G4 | Pipeline model: strictly serial stages | **Closed** | D3 | [#66](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/66) |
| G5 | Time scrubbing: two-timestep, view-specific restage | **Closed** | D4 | [#67](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/67) |
| G6 | Memory management: per-worker CPU byte limits, no GPU budget | **Closed** | D1 | [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64) |
| G7 | Threading model: serialized daemon threads, no overlap | **Closed** | D3 | [#66](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/66) |

The analysis's comparison table additionally lists *resource granularity* (full-frame
textures). That is a consequence of G2 and is addressed by D1, not tracked separately.

---

## 4. Decisions

### 4.1 D1 — GPU-resident numerical field (`LayerFrame` extended)

**Decision.** Add a **GPU-resident numerical field** alongside `LayerFrame`.

`LayerFrame` is currently defined as "immutable pixels or geometry plus content key…"
([`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 106–109) —
i.e. a CPU-produced artifact handed to a presenter. Weather fields additionally need a
form whose *numeric values* live on the GPU and are addressed by a stable identity, so
that a time change or a pan within covered area reads the resident resource rather than
re-uploading.

**Field identity** is: source + parameter + time instant + spatial window + resolution.
It is deliberately **not** a per-frame image identity.

**Revises:** the `LayerFrame` definition (lines 106–109) and extends the R5 resource
ledger (lines 251–253) to account for GPU-resident numerical fields alongside GPU
textures.

**Transport format.** Native float textures, with explicit shader arithmetic for
interpolation, replacing the current RGBA8888 bit-packing. Justification:

- Hardware linear filtering on native float textures **failed** the 2e-5 gate (max error
  2.6e-3); explicit `texelFetch` + manual bilinear arithmetic **passed** (max error
  2.4e-7) — [`rendering-m0-float-textures.md`](history/rendering-m0-float-textures.md), E1/E1b.
- Missing values must not enter shader varyings as NaN; the A0k repair (integer-exponent
  validity checks, finite missing-cell outputs, explicit validity discard) is the
  validated pattern — [`rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md`](history/rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md).

**Residency budget.** The existing ledger is extended, not replaced. Eviction protects
visible content first and reduces speculation before it reduces selected-source
fidelity, per lines 257–259.

**Issue:** [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64)

### 4.2 D2 — GPU spatial interpolation (**DECIDED 2026-10-19: option (a)**)

**Conflict.** [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md)
line 216 states, under R3:

> Keep the routing/sampling numerical interface stable.

Moving spatial sampling onto the GPU changes that interface. This cannot be left
implicit: the R3 invariant and the target architecture would then disagree.

**Options.**

| | Option (a) — amend the invariant | Option (b) — keep CPU sampling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Sample the resident field on the GPU with explicit bilinear arithmetic | Resample on the CPU, upload the resampled field |
| Effect on the R3 invariant | Requires an explicit, reviewed amendment with a stated error bound | No change |
| Fidelity | Bounded by the existing 2e-5 gate, which becomes the amendment's error bound | Same values as today |
| Benefit | Removes the largest remaining CPU cost from the interaction path | Removes per-frame upload only; CPU sampling cost remains |
| Reference parity | **Beyond the reference** — the reference samples on the CPU (T6) | Matches the reference |

**Decision: option (a) — amend the invariant.** Spatial interpolation may be evaluated
on the GPU against a resident numeric field, bounded by the existing 2e-5 gate. The
amendment is applied to
[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) at R3 item 4 and
recorded in §6.

This is an **advance beyond the reference**, which samples on the CPU (T6). It must not
be described as parity. The CPU sampler remains the reference authority and the
fallback path, and the 2e-5 gate is unchanged.

**Issue:** [#65](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/65) — now
unblocked.

### 4.3 D3 — Frame N / N+1 overlap

**Decision.** The pipeline model gains explicit **double buffering**: two sets of
prepared resources alternate, so preparation of frame N+1 overlaps presentation of frame
N.

This extends, and does not replace, the existing scheduling work. R2 already requires
that no file access or expensive portrayal happen on the interaction thread and that
requests be coalesced (lines 201–203); R4 already defines the priority order
visible > predicted > nearby > adjacent zoom (lines 231–232). Neither states that two
preparations may be in flight, nor that a superseded request must not publish.

**Added requirements:**

- At most two preparations in flight; the older is cancelled or superseded.
- Every prepared resource carries a generation key (source/time/coverage/scope);
  publication is rejected on generation mismatch.
- Coverage misses, stalled preparation, and unsupported states are **explicit** and
  distinguishable from preview/current/missing/unavailable coverage (extends line 120).
- No stale or clipped content may be presented as current.

**Revises:** the pipeline diagram (lines 77–93) and adds the generation/overlap
requirements to R2 and R4.

**Issue:** [#66](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/66)

### 4.4 D4 — Resident time windows

**Decision.** `ContentKey`'s "forecast instant/bracket" (line 103) is extended to a
**resident time window** covering multiple forecast instants over one spatial window.

Consequences:

- A time change within the window performs **zero** decodes and **zero** uploads.
- The staged `before`/`after` pair becomes a special case of a general window; the
  existing GPU temporal blend (`blend` uniform) generalizes to any instant in the
  window.
- **Time is decoupled from spatial preparation.** A time change must not invalidate
  spatial resources, and a pan must not invalidate time resources.
- Lookahead prepares the next window while the current one is displayed, so an interval
  crossing does not stall. Interval crossings, source changes, and coverage misses show
  an accurate loading state — a cached smooth scrub must not conceal poor settling.

**Revises:** the `ContentKey` definition (line 103) and extends R3's reuse requirement
(lines 212–215) from spatial to temporal reuse.

**Issue:** [#67](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/67)

### 4.5 D5 — GPU decode: explicitly deferred

**Decision.** GPU-side GRIB decompression is **deferred**, with no near-term issue.

Reasoning: R3 already warns "Do not assume windowed GRIB reads avoid full decoding;
measure actual driver behavior before choosing that optimization" (lines 222–223). The
profiled cost that matters for interaction is not the decompression itself but the
per-frame re-upload and the CPU sampling loop, which D1 and D2 address. GPU decode
would additionally require a decoder available to the GPU, which is a much larger
dependency than the residency work, and would change the numerical values produced.

**Revisit when:** D1 and D2 are landed and the remaining decode cost is re-profiled
against the new baseline. It is a separate decision, not a silent omission.

### 4.6 D6 — Independent viewport is the target weather interaction path

**Decision (2026-10-19).** The independent GRIB viewport
(`gweatherrouting/qt/gribviewport.py`) is the target weather interaction path.
The existing weather frame path (`TrackMap._gpu_frame` / MapFrame / MapScene /
WeatherStager / ContentKey) is legacy and is retired once #69 and #70 complete the
layer migration. The viewport owns camera/time state, field demand and
field/selection portrayal, and reuses the existing decoder, sampler, source
semantics and shaders.

Consequences:

- D1–D4 apply to the viewport's field store, preparation pipeline and time
  windows. Issues #64–#68 are re-pointed to that vehicle.
- The default application path stays unchanged until #70 makes an explicit
  rollout decision. Viewport work stays behind its standalone entry point and
  runtime flags.
- Charts, fill, contours and routing are not yet in the viewport. #68 and #69
  provide them before #70 can consider a default switch.
- Numerical, mask, source-order and selection gates are unchanged. Visual
  fidelity remains a separate, currently deferred gate.

**Revises:** the program target implied by §4.1–§4.4 and the issue mapping in §3.
**Issues:** [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64)–[#70](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/70);
review vehicle [#72](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/pull/72).

### 4.7 D7 — User-directed application use (2026-10-20; implemented in PR #91)

**User decision after reviewing the proposal:** start using the new viewport in the
normal application, and add explicit forecast selection to the **Weather panel**.
Prioritize these two implementation tasks over further issue/branch cleanup. The
choice of forecast belongs to the user, not an automatic multi-file fallback policy.

This authorizes the integration/default-use direction despite the recorded open
checks; it does **not** claim that those checks passed. PR #91 moved normal
Charts/Logs presentation onto the viewport without silently changing forecast
selection. D8 below supersedes D7's legacy recovery requirement. Unsupported
states remain explicit; routing calculations remain unchanged.

**Original #70 recommendation, retained as evidence rather than the current usage
decision:** keep the independent viewport **experimental**. Do **not** switch the
application's default weather interaction path to it on the evidence recorded by
[#70](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/70).

D6 named the viewport as the target interaction path and reserved the usage decision
for the user. That decision is now recorded above; the evidence and limitations
below are unchanged by the decision to begin using it.

**What the evidence says (measured, 2026-10-20, fixture `1ed1bca1…`).**

| Question | Answer | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does candidate availability survive run-to-run variance? | Six candidate-only repetitions, three before and three after the soak: 0 loading inputs in every phase, `continuous_weather` true in all six, same-payload value error 5.96e-08 and same-lattice placement error 4.17e-07. These are not alternating baseline/candidate pairs and do not prove comparative improvement or original-sampler fidelity. | [viewport-validation-summary.json](profiles/rendering/2026-10-20/viewport-validation-summary.json) |
| Is there an accounted-payload plateau, not a high-water mark? | Over 21,216 steps/900.0 s the store settles at 29,610,216 B of 128 MiB, 12 fields/no eviction; the memo at 15,627,216 B of 16 MiB; thirds agree within 0.0%. This is not RSS/VRAM or eviction-stress acceptance. | the same summary |
| Are the cold load, the coverage miss and the interval crossing separate? | Yes: 1,429.9 ms cold load, 265.2 ms coverage-miss recovery (22.1 ms to the honest loading state), 172.9 ms interval-crossing recovery (31.3 ms to the honest loading state). | the same summary |
| Does every layer report its own GPU / loading / fallback state? | Yes: the fill, the barbs and the chart each report the GPU path, an explicit loading state and no fallback. | the same summary |
| Does the retained CPU fallback work? | Yes: 24 of 24 frames current on the application's own CPU renderer on the same fixture. | the same summary |
| Is the platform matrix complete? | **No.** A device-pixel-ratio change and a Metal device loss cannot be exercised on this host; the OpenGL backend does not reproduce the Metal result (its framebuffer readback is empty); the Vulkan and software backends do not present the viewport at all. | the same summary |
| Is the workload matrix complete? | **No.** A marine-heavy workload and the application's two-map view are not in the vehicle at all. | the same summary |

**Why #70 recommended *keep-experimental*, not evidence-based acceptance.** The interaction
contract is the strongest result this program has produced, and it is not
enough to switch a default: visual fidelity is still failed and deferred, the
measurement endpoint is a render-callback proxy (presentation latency and
input-to-present latency are **unmeasured**), two workload cells and three
platform conditions are reported as gaps rather than closed, and the soak's
plateau criterion and the three separate limits are **unratified** — the
numbers are reported, but no recorded acceptance bound backs them.

**What the proposal does not cover.** Visual fidelity. Presentation or
input-to-present latency. A device-pixel-ratio change. A Metal device loss.
Marine layers. The application's two-map layout. The default application's own
start-up and draw path.

**Original proposal's consequences (not the user's chosen implementation priority).**

- The application's default weather interaction path stays as it is; the
  viewport stays behind its standalone entry point and its runtime flags.
- The legacy frame assembler is **not** retired by this proposal; D6's
  retirement step waits for a later, user-approved rollout.
- The next concrete steps are listed in the #70 summary's
  `recommendation.next_concrete_steps`: ratify or deliberately leave unratified
  the plateau and limit bounds, measure the presentation endpoint with an
  instrument that can see the compositor, close or permanently record the
  marine and two-map cells, and decide the OpenGL backend.

**Issues:** [#70](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/70),
[#51](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/51).

### 4.8 D8 — Retire the legacy map without CPU recovery (2026-10-22)

**User decision after PR #91:** continue the application migration by retiring
`TrackMap`/`mapcanvas.py`. The old QWidget map and its CPU rendering/recovery path
are not required as a fallback. If viewport rendering is unavailable, report that
state explicitly; do not silently present a blank or stale map.

This supersedes D7's requirement to preserve the legacy renderer as a recovery
path and #86's original prerequisite to retain the old map until #70's full gate
passes. It does **not** change the #70 evidence: the viewport's presentation
latency, visual fidelity, unsupported backends, marine-heavy workload and
two-map workload remain recorded limitations, not passed results. No performance
claim is made by this decision.

The old base-chart painting defect in #84 will not be repaired in the legacy
path; once that path is removed, #84 should be closed as superseded, with the
viewport's own missing-data/error reporting retained.

## 5. Relationship to the existing sequences

Three numbering schemes now coexist. This section fixes their relationship so that
agents do not follow the wrong one.

| Scheme | Scope | Granularity | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **R0–R5** ([`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 130–266) | Implementation-detail sequence | Milestone with exit criteria | **Canonical for implementation detail.** |
| **M0–M4** (epic #51, GitHub milestones) | Program phase | Phase | Canonical for program phase and target ratification. |
| **#62–#70** (GitHub issues) | Executable unit | Single bounded change with one gate | Canonical for what an agent works on. |

**Rule.** An agent works **one issue**. An issue's scope is a *subset* of the relevant
R-slice; the R-slice exit criteria still apply and are not weakened. Where this ADR and
the R-sequence disagree, **this ADR wins** (it is the later decision), and the
R-sequence is amended as recorded in §6.

---

## 6. Amendments to `rendering-implementation-plan.md`

Applied on 2026-10-19, when D2 was decided. Listed explicitly so the spec
remains the single roadmap.

| Location | Amendment |
| --- | --- |
| Lines 106–109 (`LayerFrame`) | Add a GPU-resident numerical field form; field identity is source+parameter+instant+window+resolution, not image identity. (D1) |
| Lines 251–253 (R5 ledger) | Ledger additionally accounts for GPU-resident numerical fields. (D1) |
| Line 234 (R3 invariant) | **Amended (D2 = (a)):** spatial interpolation may be evaluated on the GPU against a resident numeric field, provided values match the reference sampler within 2e-5, missing/mask semantics match exactly, and global-grid wraparound behavior matches. |
| Lines 77–93 (pipeline) | Add explicit N/N+1 overlap, ≤2 in flight, and generation-key publication rejection. (D3) |
| Line 103 (`ContentKey`) | "Forecast instant/bracket" becomes a resident time window over multiple instants. (D4) |
| Lines 212–215 (R3 reuse) | Reuse extends from spatial to temporal. (D4) |
| §4.6 (program target) | The independent viewport is the target weather interaction path; issues #64–#68 are re-pointed to it and the frame assembler is retired at #69/#70. (D6) |
| §4.7 (user direction, 2026-10-20) | **Implemented in PR #91:** use the new viewport in the application with user-controlled forecast selection. The original #70 keep-experimental recommendation and open checks remain evidence, not retroactively passed gates. (D7) |
| §4.8 (user direction, 2026-10-22) | **In progress under #86:** retire the old map without requiring its CPU recovery renderer; unavailable viewport states remain explicit. The #70 evidence gaps remain documented. (D8) |

**Deferred and not amended:** R1 (host), R0.3/R0.4 (resource envelope, platform matrix),
R5 (retention hardening, rollout). R0.2 is discharged by
[`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md).

| [`../research/gpu-weather-texture/`](../research/gpu-weather-texture/) | **Prior art for D4**, not evidence and not shipped code. Its idea — pre-compute every forecast hour's U and V bands as GPU textures once, so that moving the forecast-time slider becomes a texture lookup rather than a re-stage — is the first attempt at the resident time window that D4 now specifies. It was never merged and nothing imports it. Kept because it records a rejected approach and the reason it was rejected. |

---

## 8. Open questions

D7 application integration, §10 Weather-panel selection and the fidelity/acceptance
ledger remain implementation work. The user has decided the usage direction, not
passed the open gates. Earlier architecture questions are settled: Q1 (D2) was decided on
2026-10-19 in favour of option (a). Q2 (ADR naming
convention) resolved: ADRs live flat in `docs/` as `adr-NNN-slug.md`. Q3 (whether the
R-sequence's "Immediate implementation order" was still authoritative) resolved: R0.1
and R0.2 are discharged, and the live sequence is now the issue program. Q4 (whether
issue #69's Part 2 needs its own issue) resolved: it does not; Part 2 stays inside
#69 and begins only after Part 1 is measured.

---

## 9. Supersedes / standing constraints

This ADR does not supersede the canonical performance roadmap
([`rendering-performance-plan.md`](rendering-performance-plan.md)) or the implementation
specification. It amends them as recorded in §6.

Standing constraints carried by every implementing issue:

1. Thresholds are never relaxed: the 2e-5 numerical gate, the A0k zero-alpha
   missing-data gate, and the existing barbs selection/anchor/count/atlas gates.
2. Correctness, lifecycle, and performance are separate gates.
3. Negative results are preserved with their reasons.
4. Render callbacks are proxies, not presentation. Readback is fidelity, not timing.
5. Every change is feature-flagged, default OFF, with the default path byte-identical.

## 10. Display forecast coherence — accepted policy, implementation pending

The 2026-10-20 user review of epic #51 requires the **user** to choose the forecast
in the **Weather panel**: one chosen file and coherent model run/member for the
weather display, except explicitly defined geographic
stitching. Spatial/time interpolation within that selection is allowed; implicit
cross-file components, temporal endpoints, older-run gap filling and spatial blending
across forecast ownership are not. A file containing multiple runs/members must still
respect the chosen identity. Ensemble statistics are explicit products, not fallback.

The control must identify the selected file and its run/member, retain that choice
through camera/time changes, and report unavailable data instead of silently choosing
another forecast. Loading/enabling files in the data library is not the same action
as choosing the forecast to display. Geographic stitching is a separate explicit mode,
not automatic overlap blending.

This is a display-policy amendment, not a change to routing selection or a claim of
complete LuckGrib parity. Implementation is pending in a focused follow-up; #70's
current measured candidate remains unchanged. See
[forecast display coherence](rendering-performance-plan.md#forecast-display-coherence) for the source audit,
acceptance contract and separate resampling question; the #51 acceptance
checkpoint is in the
[archived decision log](history/rendering-decision-log.md).
