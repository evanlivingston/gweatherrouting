# ADR-001: GRIB rendering architecture — reconciliation and decisions

- **Status:** Accepted. D2 was decided on 2026-10-19 in favour of option (a); the
  amendment is applied in §6.
- **Date:** 2026-10-19
- **Supersedes:** nothing. **Amends:** [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md)
  (the R0–R5 sequence and the invariants at lines 43–70), as recorded in §6.
- **Related epic:** [#51](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/51)

This ADR is **not** a new architecture. The target architecture already exists in
[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) — see "Architecture
and ownership" (lines 71–123) and the R0–R5 implementation sequence (lines 130–266).
This document reconciles that specification with the 2026-10-19 current-state analysis and
the reference-technique analysis, records the resulting decisions, and maps them to
executable issues. It deliberately does **not** restate the specification; it links to it.

## Current checkpoint

- **Canonical roadmap and decision ledger:**
  [`rendering-performance-plan.md`](rendering-performance-plan.md) — start at its
  "Current checkpoint". This ADR is the decision input to that roadmap.
- **Implementation program:** epic #51, issues
  [#62–#70](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/62); the
  local index is [`milestones.md`](milestones.md). One issue at a time; each
  states its own gate, evidence and validation command.
- **R0–R5 implementation detail, invariants and measurement contract:**
  [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md), as
  amended by §6 below.
- **Experiment record:** the A0a–A0l slices in
  [`rendering-architecture-evaluation.md`](history/rendering-architecture-evaluation.md)
  and in the canonical plan's decision log; the M0 mechanism probes in the
  `rendering-m0-*.md` records; machine-readable evidence under
  `docs/profiles/rendering/`.
- **Status:** D1–D5 are all settled. No decision in this ADR is awaiting a user
  decision, and no A0 slice may be started from this document.
- **Wider documentation map:** [the documentation index](README.md).

## 1. Context

### 1.1 What the analyses established

| Analysis | Result |
| --- | --- |
| [`grib-architecture-analysis.md`](grib-architecture-analysis.md) | Current-state architecture with file/line citations, and the structural gaps listed in §3. |
| [`luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md`](luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md) | Reference techniques T1–T8 with explicit evidence labels and coverage limits. |

Two conclusions from the reference analysis materially shape this ADR:

1. **The reference implementation performs spatial interpolation on the CPU** (T6), not on
   the GPU. GPU spatial interpolation (D2) is therefore an advance *beyond* the reference,
   not parity work, and must never be justified as "the reference does it this way."
2. **The reference was not observed to have a unified residency budget or eviction**
   (T7). Our D1 therefore extends, rather than mirrors.

Four of the seven gaps have a direct reference analogue (T1/T4 async structure, T2 tiled
storage, T3 retained scene graph, T5 animation-state time switching). Three do not
(GPU spatial interpolation, unified GPU budget, cache-key coherence) and are places where
we can exceed the reference.

### 1.2 What the existing specification already settles

These are **not** re-decided here. Citing them so that no agent reopens them.

| Settled | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Host: mouse-transparent `QQuickWidget` for base/navigation/wind, sibling `QWidget` for route/track/AIS/dashboard | [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) line 12 and following. R0.2 is effectively discharged. |
| A resource ledger with explicit trial limits (512 MiB estimated GPU storage, 128 MiB CPU scene snapshots, 128 MiB upload payload) | [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) lines 24–26. R5 is partially discharged. |
| Layer/ownership model: `ViewState`, `ContentKey`, `LayerFrame`, UI/worker boundary, GPU boundary, publication generation rejection | [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 77–120. |
| Non-negotiable invariants (sampling, masks, interpolation, source ordering, fallback, density, glyph geometry, CPU fallback retained) | [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 56–70. |
| Measurement contract and required acceptance evidence per area | [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 267–292. |
| Program-level CPU-vs-GPU matched baseline (stationary p99 51.8→11.0 ms, pan 90.7→54.2 ms, zoom out 98.3→70.3 ms) | [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) lines 44–46. **Readback timings, not presentation.** |

---

## 2. Scope of this ADR

**In scope:** layer boundaries, ownership, data representations, scheduling model, and
the disposition of the seven structural gaps.

**Explicitly out of scope (unchanged non-negotiables):** routing calculations, source
selection and ordering, weather value fidelity, portrayal density/thinning/geometry,
the CPU fallback path, the GTK frontend, network acquisition policy, and user-data
mutation. These remain as stated in
[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 56–70.

---

## 3. Structural gaps and disposition

The seven gaps, as named in [`grib-architecture-analysis.md`](grib-architecture-analysis.md):

| # | Gap | Disposition | Decision | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Decode location: CPU (GDAL → NumPy) | **Deferred** | D5 | — |
| G2 | Data residency: CPU-side caches, no GPU-resident field | **Closed** | D1 | [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64) |
| G3 | Spatial interpolation: CPU Python loops | **Closed** | D2 | [#65](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/65) |
| G4 | Pipeline model: strictly serial stages | **Closed** | D3 | [#66](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/66) |
| G5 | Time scrubbing: two-timestep, view-specific restage | **Closed** | D4 | [#67](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/67) |
| G6 | Memory management: per-worker CPU byte limits, no GPU budget | **Closed** | D1 | [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64) |
| G7 | Threading model: serialized daemon threads, no overlap | **Closed** | D3 | [#66](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/66) |

The analysis's comparison table additionally lists *resource granularity* (full-frame
textures). That is a consequence of G2 and is addressed by D1, not tracked separately.

---

## 4. Decisions

### 4.1 D1 — GPU-resident numerical field (`LayerFrame` extended)

**Decision.** Add a **GPU-resident numerical field** alongside `LayerFrame`.

`LayerFrame` is currently defined as "immutable pixels or geometry plus content key…"
([`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 106–109) —
i.e. a CPU-produced artifact handed to a presenter. Weather fields additionally need a
form whose *numeric values* live on the GPU and are addressed by a stable identity, so
that a time change or a pan within covered area reads the resident resource rather than
re-uploading.

**Field identity** is: source + parameter + time instant + spatial window + resolution.
It is deliberately **not** a per-frame image identity.

**Revises:** the `LayerFrame` definition (lines 106–109) and extends the R5 resource
ledger (lines 251–253) to account for GPU-resident numerical fields alongside GPU
textures.

**Transport format.** Native float textures, with explicit shader arithmetic for
interpolation, replacing the current RGBA8888 bit-packing. Justification:

- Hardware linear filtering on native float textures **failed** the 2e-5 gate (max error
  2.6e-3); explicit `texelFetch` + manual bilinear arithmetic **passed** (max error
  2.4e-7) — [`rendering-m0-float-textures.md`](history/rendering-m0-float-textures.md), E1/E1b.
- Missing values must not enter shader varyings as NaN; the A0k repair (integer-exponent
  validity checks, finite missing-cell outputs, explicit validity discard) is the
  validated pattern — [`rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md`](history/rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md).

**Residency budget.** The existing ledger is extended, not replaced. Eviction protects
visible content first and reduces speculation before it reduces selected-source
fidelity, per lines 257–259.

**Issue:** [#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64)

### 4.2 D2 — GPU spatial interpolation (**DECIDED 2026-10-19: option (a)**)

**Conflict.** [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md)
line 216 states, under R3:

> Keep the routing/sampling numerical interface stable.

Moving spatial sampling onto the GPU changes that interface. This cannot be left
implicit: the R3 invariant and the target architecture would then disagree.

**Options.**

| | Option (a) — amend the invariant | Option (b) — keep CPU sampling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Sample the resident field on the GPU with explicit bilinear arithmetic | Resample on the CPU, upload the resampled field |
| Effect on the R3 invariant | Requires an explicit, reviewed amendment with a stated error bound | No change |
| Fidelity | Bounded by the existing 2e-5 gate, which becomes the amendment's error bound | Same values as today |
| Benefit | Removes the largest remaining CPU cost from the interaction path | Removes per-frame upload only; CPU sampling cost remains |
| Reference parity | **Beyond the reference** — the reference samples on the CPU (T6) | Matches the reference |

**Decision: option (a) — amend the invariant.** Spatial interpolation may be evaluated
on the GPU against a resident numeric field, bounded by the existing 2e-5 gate. The
amendment is applied to
[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) at R3 item 4 and
recorded in §6.

This is an **advance beyond the reference**, which samples on the CPU (T6). It must not
be described as parity. The CPU sampler remains the reference authority and the
fallback path, and the 2e-5 gate is unchanged.

**Issue:** [#65](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/65) — now
unblocked.

### 4.3 D3 — Frame N / N+1 overlap

**Decision.** The pipeline model gains explicit **double buffering**: two sets of
prepared resources alternate, so preparation of frame N+1 overlaps presentation of frame
N.

This extends, and does not replace, the existing scheduling work. R2 already requires
that no file access or expensive portrayal happen on the interaction thread and that
requests be coalesced (lines 201–203); R4 already defines the priority order
visible > predicted > nearby > adjacent zoom (lines 231–232). Neither states that two
preparations may be in flight, nor that a superseded request must not publish.

**Added requirements:**

- At most two preparations in flight; the older is cancelled or superseded.
- Every prepared resource carries a generation key (source/time/coverage/scope);
  publication is rejected on generation mismatch.
- Coverage misses, stalled preparation, and unsupported states are **explicit** and
  distinguishable from preview/current/missing/unavailable coverage (extends line 120).
- No stale or clipped content may be presented as current.

**Revises:** the pipeline diagram (lines 77–93) and adds the generation/overlap
requirements to R2 and R4.

**Issue:** [#66](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/66)

### 4.4 D4 — Resident time windows

**Decision.** `ContentKey`'s "forecast instant/bracket" (line 103) is extended to a
**resident time window** covering multiple forecast instants over one spatial window.

Consequences:

- A time change within the window performs **zero** decodes and **zero** uploads.
- The staged `before`/`after` pair becomes a special case of a general window; the
  existing GPU temporal blend (`blend` uniform) generalizes to any instant in the
  window.
- **Time is decoupled from spatial preparation.** A time change must not invalidate
  spatial resources, and a pan must not invalidate time resources.
- Lookahead prepares the next window while the current one is displayed, so an interval
  crossing does not stall. Interval crossings, source changes, and coverage misses show
  an accurate loading state — a cached smooth scrub must not conceal poor settling.

**Revises:** the `ContentKey` definition (line 103) and extends R3's reuse requirement
(lines 212–215) from spatial to temporal reuse.

**Issue:** [#67](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/67)

### 4.5 D5 — GPU decode: explicitly deferred

**Decision.** GPU-side GRIB decompression is **deferred**, with no near-term issue.

Reasoning: R3 already warns "Do not assume windowed GRIB reads avoid full decoding;
measure actual driver behavior before choosing that optimization" (lines 222–223). The
profiled cost that matters for interaction is not the decompression itself but the
per-frame re-upload and the CPU sampling loop, which D1 and D2 address. GPU decode
would additionally require a decoder available to the GPU, which is a much larger
dependency than the residency work, and would change the numerical values produced.

**Revisit when:** D1 and D2 are landed and the remaining decode cost is re-profiled
against the new baseline. It is a separate decision, not a silent omission.

## 5. Relationship to the existing sequences

Three numbering schemes now coexist. This section fixes their relationship so that
agents do not follow the wrong one.

| Scheme | Scope | Granularity | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **R0–R5** ([`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) lines 130–266) | Implementation-detail sequence | Milestone with exit criteria | **Canonical for implementation detail.** |
| **M0–M4** (epic #51, GitHub milestones) | Program phase | Phase | Canonical for program phase and target ratification. |
| **#62–#70** (GitHub issues) | Executable unit | Single bounded change with one gate | Canonical for what an agent works on. |

**Rule.** An agent works **one issue**. An issue's scope is a *subset* of the relevant
R-slice; the R-slice exit criteria still apply and are not weakened. Where this ADR and
the R-sequence disagree, **this ADR wins** (it is the later decision), and the
R-sequence is amended as recorded in §6.

---

## 6. Amendments to `rendering-implementation-plan.md`

Applied on 2026-10-19, when D2 was decided. Listed explicitly so the spec
remains the single roadmap.

| Location | Amendment |
| --- | --- |
| Lines 106–109 (`LayerFrame`) | Add a GPU-resident numerical field form; field identity is source+parameter+instant+window+resolution, not image identity. (D1) |
| Lines 251–253 (R5 ledger) | Ledger additionally accounts for GPU-resident numerical fields. (D1) |
| Line 234 (R3 invariant) | **Amended (D2 = (a)):** spatial interpolation may be evaluated on the GPU against a resident numeric field, provided values match the reference sampler within 2e-5, missing/mask semantics match exactly, and global-grid wraparound behavior matches. |
| Lines 77–93 (pipeline) | Add explicit N/N+1 overlap, ≤2 in flight, and generation-key publication rejection. (D3) |
| Line 103 (`ContentKey`) | "Forecast instant/bracket" becomes a resident time window over multiple instants. (D4) |
| Lines 212–215 (R3 reuse) | Reuse extends from spatial to temporal. (D4) |

**Deferred and not amended:** R1 (host), R0.3/R0.4 (resource envelope, platform matrix),
R5 (retention hardening, rollout). R0.2 is discharged by
[`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md).

## 7. Evidence index

| Artifact | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| [`grib-architecture-analysis.md`](grib-architecture-analysis.md) | Current state; the seven gaps. |
| [`luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md`](luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md) | Reference techniques T1–T8; T6 correction (CPU spatial interpolation). |
| [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) | The architecture being reconciled; invariants; R0–R5; measurement contract. |
| [`gpu-embedded-rendering.md`](gpu-embedded-rendering.md) | Host decision; resource ledger; matched CPU/GPU baseline. |
| [`rendering-m0-float-textures.md`](history/rendering-m0-float-textures.md) | E1/E1b: native float transport; hardware filtering fails 2e-5, explicit arithmetic passes. |
| [`rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md`](history/rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md) | Missing-data handling; zero-alpha gate; the red-flood failure and its repair. |
| [`rendering-a0j-early-display.md`](history/rendering-a0j-early-display.md) | Early weather before chart readiness; camera/clock preservation. |
| [`rendering-a0h-resident-worker.md`](history/rendering-a0h-resident-worker.md) | Single-owner retained worker; exact deferred fidelity. |
| [`rendering-architecture-evaluation.md`](history/rendering-architecture-evaluation.md) | A0a–A0k results **including the negative ones**; the "do not adopt on one pair" discipline. |
| [`profiles/rendering/2026-10-18/a0c-timeline-scrub-summary.json`](profiles/rendering/2026-10-18/a0c-timeline-scrub-summary.json) | Scrub cost: 41 uploads / 568 MB; dispatch p95 357.7 ms. The cost D1/D3/D4 remove. |
| [`profiles/rendering/2026-10-18/a0h-resident-worker-summary.json`](profiles/rendering/2026-10-18/a0h-resident-worker-summary.json) | Resident preparation 1.18–1.31 s vs 1.79–1.96 s; GUI bind 2.2–5.9 ms. |
| [`rendering-m0-measurement-audit.md`](rendering-m0-measurement-audit.md) | What the instrumentation can and cannot prove; why readback is not presentation. |
| [`profiling-priorities.md`](profiling-priorities.md) | Already-measured pan cost (0.841 s inclusive in `live_geometry_for_view`). Do not re-measure. |
| [`../research/gpu-weather-texture/`](../research/gpu-weather-texture/) | **Prior art for D4**, not evidence and not shipped code. Its idea — pre-compute every forecast hour's U and V bands as GPU textures once, so that moving the forecast-time slider becomes a texture lookup rather than a re-stage — is the first attempt at the resident time window that D4 now specifies. It was never merged and nothing imports it. Kept because it records a rejected approach and the reason it was rejected. |

---

## 8. Open questions

None. Q1 (D2) was decided on 2026-10-19 in favour of option (a). Q2 (ADR naming
convention) resolved: ADRs live flat in `docs/` as `adr-NNN-slug.md`. Q3 (whether the
R-sequence's "Immediate implementation order" was still authoritative) resolved: R0.1
and R0.2 are discharged, and the live sequence is now the issue program. Q4 (whether
issue #69's Part 2 needs its own issue) resolved: it does not; Part 2 stays inside
#69 and begins only after Part 1 is measured.

---

## 9. Supersedes / standing constraints

This ADR does not supersede the canonical performance roadmap
([`rendering-performance-plan.md`](rendering-performance-plan.md)) or the implementation
specification. It amends them as recorded in §6.

Standing constraints carried by every implementing issue:

1. Thresholds are never relaxed: the 2e-5 numerical gate, the A0k zero-alpha
   missing-data gate, and the existing barbs selection/anchor/count/atlas gates.
2. Correctness, lifecycle, and performance are separate gates.
3. Negative results are preserved with their reasons.
4. Render callbacks are proxies, not presentation. Readback is fidelity, not timing.
5. Every change is feature-flagged, default OFF, with the default path byte-identical.
