# Rendering performance: current state

Tracking epic: [#51](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/51).
This file states the current architecture decision, what shipped, the
invariants, the acceptance gates and the one next decision. It is not a work
queue and it is not a log: the issue body is the spec for a task, and past
experiment records live in [`history/`](history/).

## How to use this file

| You want | Read |
| --- | --- |
| What to build next | the issue body. It states the gap, scope, non-goals, acceptance gate and validation command |
| The accepted architecture decision (D1-D7) | [ADR-001](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md), the section your task touches |
| The invariants and the measurement contract | [the implementation plan](rendering-implementation-plan.md), section `Reference and invariants` |
| What shipped and what is not claimed | this file, `Current state` |
| Why a past decision was made | [`history/rendering-decision-log.md`](history/rendering-decision-log.md) |

Read only the section you need. Every result, threshold, negative result and
budget stays on the record: in this file, in the issue body, or behind a link
to the document that records it. Nothing is deleted evidence.

## Current state

**Decision (ADR-001 D1-D7).** The renderer is split into decoupled layers with
explicit ownership: weather preparation, chart composition and presentation are
separate, and the Qt viewport owns the scene graph. Issues #62-#73 are closed;
epic [#51](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/51) stays
open for the follow-on work.

**What shipped.** Native weather fields are on by default: a GPU-resident field
cache under one shared session byte budget, merged in PR #82 for
[#64](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/64) (closed
2026-10-21). `--no-native-weather-fields` or `GWR_NATIVE_WEATHER_FIELDS=0`
restores the Image path, and geographic barb layout is the default
(`--screen-barbs` restores the old). ENC charts are enabled by default in the
application viewport (PR #81);
[#78](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/78) closed
2026-10-21 after 13/13 functional and 14/14 combined-experience checks plus 104
targeted integration passes.

**What is not claimed.** The application still uses `mapcanvas.TrackMap` as its
map; the standalone viewport is opt-in, and moving the whole application onto
it is [#88](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/88).
[#70](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/70) closed
2026-10-21 as **keep-experimental**: the default application path was not
switched. Presentation and input-to-present latency are unmeasured; the recorded
endpoint is a render-callback proxy, never FPS. #64's recorded limits stand:
stale in-flight completions are covered by headless tests only, true device loss
is not exercisable, there is no single repeatable `residency-native` gate, byte
figures are texture payload not physical VRAM, upload counts are QRhi
submissions not GPU completion, and the original-sampler
([#65](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/65)) fidelity
dependency is unchanged.

**Display policy.** The user chooses the forecast in the Weather panel; the
application must not silently pick a different file/run/member while the user
pans or changes forecast time. See `Forecast display coherence` below.

**Next decision.** Make the full desktop application work with the new viewport
and the world basemap
([#88](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/88)), then
decide whether the old default map is removed
([#86](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/86)). Removal is
gated on #70 acceptance, which closed as keep-experimental and therefore has
not passed. The ENC chart engine is under
evaluation against tile57
([#87](https://github.com/evanlivingston/gweatherrouting/issues/87)); that is an
evaluation, not a removal.

**Evidence identity.** Per-experiment contracts and results are in the history
records linked below. Recorded evidence under
[`profiles/rendering/`](profiles/rendering/) is the reference: do not re-measure
a baseline the change does not touch, and do not attribute a measurement to a
later commit than the one it was taken on.

## Forecast display coherence

**Accepted user policy, 2026-10-20; implementation pending.** The user chooses the
forecast in the Weather panel; the application must not silently pick a different
file/run/member while the user pans or changes forecast time. This is a display-policy
amendment, not a routing change or complete LuckGrib equivalence claim. The
[static trace](luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md#2026-10-20-follow-up-file-selection-and-interpolation-boundary)
supports a selected-file evaluator, but does not prove whole-map pinning or the
handling of multiple production runs in one container. Our whole-display rule is
explicitly stricter.

### Policy

- Add an explicit Weather-panel selector, distinct from loading/enabling forecast
  files in the data library. Show which file, model run and member are selected;
  unavailable data must remain visible as unavailable, not trigger substitution.
- Pin the user-chosen file, model, production/reference time, ensemble member and field/
  level. Requested forecast **valid time** is distinct from production time. Fields,
  barbs, contours, display point queries and labels must agree on selection.
- Spatial interpolation, same-file temporal interpolation and explicitly identified
  same-source single-endpoint holding remain allowed within declared coverage.
  A multi-run/member container must still respect the chosen identity.
- Do not implicitly borrow U/V components, time endpoints, fields or masked regions
  from another file/run/model. Missing remains unavailable. Shared model/run metadata
  alone does not authorize split-file pairing or temporal interpolation.
- Multiple files require explicit geographic stitching: region ownership, overlap
  priority and allowed model/run/member compatibility. Until specified and tested,
  stitching is unsupported. Do not spatially blend different forecast owners.
- Ensemble members stay separate; an explicitly selected mean/statistical product
  is different from silently combining enabled forecasts.

### Why this is separate from the pixel/value differences

The viewport's `viewport-gridded-field-summary.json` reports 0.1256 m/s maximum and
0.0192 m/s mean wind-speed difference against the original sampler at 40 positions.
The approximately 4.17e-7 m/s GPU placement/arithmetic check compares interpolation
of the **same staged lattice**, not the original sampler. Neither proves a general
resampling bound. The logical/device-pixel missing-node probe defect is separately
recorded as corrected; visual fidelity is still deferred.

**No inspected result establishes forecast mixing as the cause of any reported
resampling or visual mismatch.** Reproduce differences with coherent selection before
assigning a cause; preserve the old evidence instead of overwriting it.

### Code evidence and follow-up contract

Source audit of the viewport branch (initial inspected HEAD `b27d33e`):

- `core/gribsampling.py`, `GridIndex._records` groups by reference/model/level, not
  file. `WeatherSampler._wind_pairs` prefers complete same-file pairs but permits
  cross-file components; `_side`/`_blend` allow different files' temporal endpoints
  within one identity. Distinct identities/runs are not directly time-blended.
- `sample_timestamps` fills missing points from later eligible identities, including
  older runs. `rendering/weatherstaging.py` retains these rules. This policy predates
  the viewport; existing cross-file/fallback tests are intentional, not defective.
- `qt/shaders/weather.frag` receives values without file/run ownership and cannot
  reject cross-owner spatial blending. Generation rejection/source signatures ensure
  freshness, not coherence. Permitted mechanisms are not proof of actual fixture mixing.

**Implementation boundary:** select a display file/run before staging; constrain
components/endpoints; carry structured identity through publication/cache keys and
invalidate on switches. Do not globally change `WeatherSampler` or routing. Use
the integrated viewport base; #70's old measurements remain valid only for its
old candidate/policy, not a changed workload.

**Focused tests:** preserve same-source interpolation, exact-time masks and allowed
holding; reject unauthorized split-file components/endpoints, older-run gap fill and
mixed runs/members in one file; test pan/scrub pinning, transitions, provenance/cache
identity and stale-publication rejection across all displayed weather layers. Keep
stitching disabled until its boundary policy is explicit. Preserve routing tests.

**One-view fidelity gate:** freeze a representative view, chosen file/run/member,
timestamps and geographic probe coordinates. Compare direct sampler and staged-lattice
U/V, speed and validity with pointwise provenance, including gradients and missing/
coverage edges; assess matched fill/barb/chart captures separately from timed runs.
The reported 40-point summary lacks checked-in pointwise reproduction, so retain
coordinates/results and denominators. Existing numerical/mask/selection gates stay;
no new approximation tolerance is approved. Record an implementation/measurement
budget before starting, stop at an explicit pass/revise/blocked fidelity verdict,
and leave broad performance/rollout gates open. No native work is authorized by the
documentation-only consolidation phase.

## Reference workload and acceptance

Reuse a verified private startup snapshot, including its source ordering,
checksums, frozen forecast clock, saved settings/layout, density, and layers.
The [October 15 report](rendering-startup-baseline-2026-10-15.md) is historical
evidence, not a current baseline. B1 located and verified the existing October 16
snapshot referenced by [continuous-pan work](history/rendering-pan-prediction.md). Its
content hash matches the historical snapshot, but its frozen clock is October 16
08:00; clock and content identity must both match for comparison. If unavailable
or no longer representative, record the blocker and version any replacement;
never silently substitute a new workload.

Replay pan/zoom/reversal and forecast scrubs within/across intervals, charts
alone and with fill/barbs/contours/streamlines, then both maps visible. The
existing snapshot has no marine fields according to the October 16 report;
marine-heavy acceptance needs a separately identified fixture.

Record input dispatch, GUI work, rendering/submission callbacks, cadence,
preparation/publication delay, uploads, memory, backend/fallback, and usable-data
coverage. Distinguish warm interaction, initial load, new coverage, and interval
crossings. A prepared image enclosing the viewport is not proof of usable
forecast coverage. Missing content must not count as a speed improvement.

Proposed targets (pending explicit ratification before acceptance):

- warm p95 frame time within the reference display refresh budget;
- p95 input-to-present below 50 ms, using a defensible presentation endpoint;
- camera movement remains responsive while preparation is deliberately stalled;
- bounded memory with a measured plateau under repeated travel/time/source changes;
- separate numerical limits for cold load, settling, memory, and coverage gaps,
  to be chosen after the baseline, not retrofitted to candidate results.

Qt render/swap callbacks are proxy endpoints, **not** scanout/input-to-photon
proof. For a QQuickWidget, its offscreen scene rendering alone does not establish
the top-level widget's presentation. Label each endpoint precisely; leave true
presentation acceptance unmeasured if the available instrumentation cannot prove
it. Do not rename request-to-render or grab duration as input-to-present.

All numerical/source-selection and portrayal invariants in the historical
[implementation specification](rendering-implementation-plan.md#reference-and-invariants)
remain applicable. Intentional display approximations need documented bounds
and explicit review. Routing remains unchanged.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Exit gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 Baseline + architecture decision | Reproducible real-workload evidence; E1–E3 decisions; selected host/ownership/residency design | **Closed 2026-10-19** (ADR-001 accepted) |
| M1 Bounded residency | Real forecasts work inside an explicit budget with sampler/provenance equivalence and resource release | **Closed** (#64, #71) |
| M2 Production fill + barbs | Retained numerical layers, cheap camera/time changes, accurate loading state, matched fidelity/performance gates | **Closed** (#65-#69, #73) |
| M3 Remaining bottlenecks | Reprofile, then retain contours/streamlines and address charts/navigation only as justified | **Closed** (#69); contours and streamlines stay out of the viewport |
| M4 Validation + rollout | Soak, lifecycle/DPR/context/backend coverage and explicit approval for rollout | **Closed 2026-10-21: keep-experimental**; the default application path was not switched |

Do not interpret a later milestone as an instruction to implement it before its
predecessor passes. A negative experiment can close an uncertainty successfully.

## Hypothesis ledger

| ID | Hypothesis | Evidence / decision | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B0 | Existing startup tool already measures native input-to-present | Rejected by source audit: every measured step forces grab/readback; retain for synchronous diagnostics only | Rejected |
| B1 | Embedded native replay can expose useful asynchronous timing without readback | Two native runs and deterministic attribution checks; usable only as a render-signal proxy, not presentation | Supported (limited) |
| E1 | Native numerical textures are suitable for production fields | Float transport and explicit interpolation passed in native QRhiWidget; hardware filtering failed original gate; map integration/lifecycle open | Supported mechanism only |
| E2 | Retained camera/time state removes preparation from warm interaction | Exact retained selection and native GPU indirection pass; worker-only app control did not demonstrate latency win; full-app persistent-resource/atomic handoff test next | Supported mechanism; interaction unproven |
| E3 | Actual forecast selection fits bounded on-demand residency | Saved-view lattice and actual #50 staging fit; values/masks/provenance checked; broader coverage/eviction/soak open | Supported saved-view slice |
| A0 | A coherent decoupled renderer improves whole map/weather interaction | A0g coverage/freshness correctness passes. A0h retained numerical owner and clean timing pass two matched pairs with lower preparation cost and exact deferred fidelity. Empty-only oracle correction documented. Legacy chart/startup, broader workloads, memory and presentation remain open. | Numerical ownership/measurement supported; whole-path architecture acceptance open |

## Evidence and comparison rules

- Every result records code commit/dirty diff identity, harness identity, snapshot
  identity, backend, hardware/display/DPR, environment, commands, raw samples,
  repetitions, warm-up, failures and limitations. Keep private paths/data local.
- Compare matched workloads and instrumentation; use interleaved baseline and
  candidate runs where practical. Profile runs are attribution, not timing runs.
- Version changed measurement semantics. Historical grab p99 is not native FPS.
- A synthetic mechanism pass cannot replace real-forecast acceptance. Tests prove
  correctness, measurements prove performance, and coverage checks prove neither
  was achieved by losing content.
- Resource estimates and RSS high-water are not measured GPU residency or a
  memory plateau. Windowed GDAL reads may still decode full bands: measure it.
- Use architectural observations from supplied decompilation only as hypotheses;
  independently implement techniques, not recovered proprietary code.

## Working/review rules

Each slice identifies its milestone and hypothesis, then records question,
scope/non-goals, baseline/protocol/success criterion, fidelity gates, budget/stop
condition, and result/decision. Each PR summarizes:
**milestone → hypothesis → evidence → decision → remaining gap**.

After each experiment/milestone or exhausted budget, record:

1. Did the actual workload improve, or did we only establish a mechanism?
2. Is the original bottleneck still dominant?
3. What uncertainty remains, and is the next step still justified?
4. **Continue / narrow / pivot / stop**, with rationale and any new budget.

No silent scope expansion or moving acceptance criteria to match results. Keep
one current milestone and one next decision here and on the epic. Link detailed
results/child issues instead of proliferating roadmaps. Existing uncommitted work
and open PRs retain their own scope; this epic does not authorize their overwrite
or merge. Ask before pushing/creating PRs when not already authorized.
