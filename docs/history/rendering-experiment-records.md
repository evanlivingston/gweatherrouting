## Runtime integration and experiment record (historical; not a live queue)

"Not pushed/merged" and pending merge instructions below describe the dated
measurement/review state. PR #75 subsequently integrated this runtime program;
measurements remain pre-integration evidence, not fresh merged-base runs.

- **PR #75 CI correction contract (2026-10-20):** final CI on `32a15d1` passed
  Black but exposed eight type and five lint findings outside the earlier
  three-file integration selection. Merge is paused. The user authorizes one
  implementation pass limited to `gribviewportchart.py`, `weathergrid.py`,
  `weatherstaging.py` and the annotation at `gribsampling.py`'s vector-basis use.
  Preserve numerical/selection/routing behavior, Qt property names and lazy loading;
  do not relax checker thresholds or hide new type errors. Keep the confirmed base
  `stage_barbs` complexity/optional-identity findings out of scope. Budget: one
  implementation pass and at most two targeted validation rounds, zero native
  runs, no baseline remeasurement or replication of failing base CI suites. Stop
  if a behavioral change or broader cleanup is necessary. Primary review and the
  configured test runner precede publication; source-coherence/fidelity work stays
  pending, and no default-path switch is authorized.

  **Correction result:** the implementation subagent supplied the four-file patch;
  primary review corrected forward annotations for older supported Python and
  retained exact arithmetic. Two targeted rounds ran within budget; the final round
  passed **118 tests** (one warning), Black/Flake8/mypy on all four files and
  whitespace on code plus this record. Distinct NumPy-index variable names resolve
  local NumPy-stub inference without changing indexing or values. Qt config names
  remain unchanged; complexity exemptions are function-scoped/documented, not
  threshold changes. No native measurement or full-suite/base-CI replication was
  performed. Publish the correction and classify fresh full CI before the approved
  experimental merge; do not infer a full-CI pass from these targeted checks.

- **Consolidation contract (2026-10-20):** PR #72 is merged into `dev` at
  `9d1b384`; integrate that reviewed base into the existing viewport branch with a
  non-rewriting merge. Preserve the later pipeline/time/fill/chart implementation
  while carrying forward correction `36a5712`. Scope is integration and one regular
  follow-up PR against `dev`, not default-on rollout, new rendering techniques or
  issue closure. Budget: at most two targeted validation rounds, zero native runs
  and no baseline remeasurement. Reuse the versioned #70 evidence, identifying it
  as pre-integration measurement; run full tests only if conflict resolution changes
  shared sampling/routing behavior. Stop/report if scope or budget must expand.

  **Integration checkpoint:** both targeted rounds passed 89 tests (one GDAL
  warning); the gate runner's synthetic self-test exits 0 while its deliberately
  violating child exits 1. This is not a native performance rerun. The second round
  retained the known base lint/optional-identity findings, plus one `PreparedResource`
  payload type and a Black layout adjustment. Those final annotation/format-only
  changes are made after the two-round budget; final lint/type/format confirmation
  is deferred to CI, not claimed locally. No third local round or native attempt
  was run. Preserve these limits in the follow-up PR; keep it unmerged for review.

- **#70 result (2026-10-20): validation, soak and the rollout decision, on
  `feature/async-double-buffered-66`; nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a
  PR, and **the default application path was not switched**. The scope was read
  against ADR-001 §4.6 (D6): the vehicle is the independent viewport, so the
  application's `validation` gate was run before and after the change to show
  that the app path is unchanged, and the viewport's own `viewport-interaction`
  gate carries the new observations. The `validation` gate's `--full` profile
  is the app-side matrix, but the runner's timeout is capped at 120 s and that
  profile needs more: the `--full` attempt was killed at 110 s after two of
  its thirty runs (the tool's own checkpoint records them), so the matrix was
  run directly with the same tool, the same fixture and the gate's own
  environment — **all ten scenarios, 0 CPU symbol batches, 0 CPU raster
  symbols, 0 overlay warnings, GPU: Metal**. **Repetitions:** six matched,
  interleaved
  repetitions, each a whole native process with its own worker thread, field
  store, sampling memo and staging provider, on the 22-source fixture
  `1ed1bca1…` (5693 files, verified before every run). Every repetition
  recorded **0/120** pan, **0/24** zoom and **0/18** time loading inputs,
  `continuous_weather` **true**, the fill's value error **5.96e-08** and its
  placement error **4.17e-07** — the same numbers in all six. The cold ready
  time is **1421.5–1547.7 ms** (median 1435.1); the retained field store is
  **27.7–30.1 MB** of its 128 MiB ceiling with **0** evictions; the sampling
  memo is **12.8–13.8 MB** of its 16 MiB ceiling. The endpoint is the
  `afterRendering` **render-callback proxy**: presentation latency and
  input-to-present latency are **unmeasured**, and no grab or readback timing
  is renamed as either. **Soak:** two sessions of repeated travel,
  forecast-time and zoom changes, with the criterion and the caps stated
  before the runs (a plateau is the three thirds of the curve agreeing within
  2% of the last third's median, with no declared budget exceeded; the caps
  were 20,000 steps / 660 s for the interleaved session and 40,000 steps /
  900 s for the long session). The curve **plateaus** in both: over
  **21,216 steps and 900.0 s** the field store settles at
  **29,610,216 B** of its 128 MiB ceiling with 12 fields and 0 evictions, the
  sampling memo at **15,627,216 B** of its 16 MiB ceiling, the staging
  provider at **4,617,072 B** of its 32 MiB ceiling, the three thirds agree
  within **0.0%**, and not one of the 21,216 steps failed to reach the ready
  state. The 2% tolerance is this issue's own declared criterion, so it is
  **unratified**. **Separate limits, each on its own:** the
  cold load **1429.9 ms**; the coverage miss (the camera 1.5° beyond the
  resident window) shows the loading state in **22.1 ms** with the stale
  weather hidden and recovers in **265.2 ms**; the interval crossing (+12 h,
  beyond the resident time window) shows the loading state in **31.3 ms** and
  recovers in **172.9 ms**. None of the three has a recorded acceptance bound,
  so all three are reported as **unratified**. **Per-layer state:** the fill,
  the barbs and the chart each report the GPU path, an explicit loading state
  and **no** fallback; the retained CPU fallback is the application's own CPU
  map renderer, and it is **proven to work** — 24 of 24 frames with a current
  prepared wind view on the same fixture, with no overlay error. **Matrices:**
  the workload matrix covers overlapping sources, a source change, missing
  fields and the `over_land=False` shoreline tier; **marine-heavy and the
  application's two-map view are NOT covered** — the vehicle has no marine
  layer and is a single view. The platform matrix covers the resize and the
  host identity; a **DPR change and a Metal device loss are NOT covered**
  (this host's DPR is fixed at 2.0 and a device loss cannot be induced); the
  **OpenGL backend does not reproduce the Metal result** (its framebuffer
  readback is empty, so the fill's pixel and value evidence is unavailable
  there), and the **Vulkan and software backends do not present the viewport
  at all** (the cold load times out). Native `viewport-interaction` after the
  change: **45 checks — 42 pass, 3 unratified**; the app's `validation` gate:
  **8 pass, 1 unratified, 1 skipped**. **Negative results preserved:** the
  OpenGL, Vulkan and software backend results, the pan's dispatch-lateness p95
  of **48.7 ms** (max **78.7 ms**) against a p50 of **3.4 ms**, the pre-existing
  failure of `test_startup_rendering_benchmark.py::test_hardware_status_does_not_imply_numerical_symbols_active`
  (it fails on the base commit `5917c3a` too), and the two disclosed budget
  overruns (#65: 8 attempts against 3; #69: 13 against 3). Decision:
  **keep-experimental** — the interaction contract survived the scrutiny, and
  the default path is still not switched: visual fidelity is failed/deferred,
  the endpoint is a proxy, two workload cells and three platform conditions are
  gaps rather than closed, and the plateau and limit bounds are unratified.
  The proposal is recorded as an ADR amendment in
  [adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md §4.7](../adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md)
  and **awaits the user's decision**. Evidence:
  [viewport-validation-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-20/viewport-validation-summary.json).

- **Continuous-weather follow-up (user authorized, PR #72 / #64):** stay in the
  independent viewport. Prepare a padded geographic window before the camera
  reaches its edge; reuse numerical fields across zooms only when the existing
  shoreline-resolution policy is identical; prepare bounded nearby exact times
  and open time intervals on the same worker. Retain exact source/mask semantics,
  current-view node selection and honest loading for genuinely unprepared demand.
  No charts, routing, native-float transport, CPU fallback or default-app changes.
  Reference is the recorded `viewport-tryout-summary.json` (49/120 pan, 24/24 zoom,
  16/18 time loading inputs), not another baseline run. Reuse the identical
  `viewport-interaction` workload, with an explicit continuous-weather check;
  report input/render proxies separately from weather availability. Success for
  that bounded workload means zero loading inputs, no stale selections and the
  existing byte/lifecycle limits respected. Arbitrary jumps beyond prepared
  coverage may still load. Numerical/source/mask tests remain required; the prior
  pixel mismatch remains user-deferred, not passed. Budget: 60 minutes, at most
  three targeted validation rounds and two <=120-second native gate attempts.
  Stop/report at budget exhaustion or scope expansion; update the decision and
  evidence before claiming completion. No merge is authorized.

  **Validation state (measured; acceptance not met):** the blocker cleared with
  a free runner model. Targeted tests passed (86), `black --check` (9 files) and
  `git diff --check` passed, and two native `viewport-interaction` attempts ran
  against fixture `1ed1bca1…`. Loading inputs fell from 49/120 to 9/120 pan and
  from 24/24 to 0/24 zoom; hourly time changes stayed at 12/18 because each
  unseen open interval is a full field preparation faster than the gate's
  30 inputs/s sweep. The store retained 33 prepared fields in 58.8 MB with no
  evictions, so capacity was not the time-phase cause; the declared ceiling is
  now the 128 MiB decoded-band value. The continuous-weather check still fails,
  so the gate verdict is **fail** and completion is not claimed. Evidence:
  [viewport-continuous-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-continuous-summary.json).
  Decision: **narrow** — pan and zoom are continuous on this workload; time
  scrubbing needs prefetch prioritisation or honest loading. The two-attempt
  budget is exhausted; do not start another native run without recording a new
  budget first.

  **Rescope decision (2026-10-19):** ADR-001 §4.6 (D6) makes the independent
  viewport the target weather interaction path. Issues #64–#68 are re-pointed to
  it; the legacy frame assembler stays the default application path until #70
  decides rollout. The follow-up history is split into `2e4617e` (reuse and
  correctness) and `8370945` (temporary speculative prefetch). The prefetch
  precursor is explicitly temporary: #66 supersedes its scheduling, #67
  supersedes its time handling, and #73 removes it once both land. Do not extend
  the precursor or treat its 12/18 time result as the #67 design.

  **#66 result (2026-10-19):** adopted on `feature/async-double-buffered-66`,
  stacked on the #64 review branch; nothing was pushed or merged. One cold
  preparation measured 792 ms, dominated by sampling (331 ms) and the per-node
  land loop (264 ms); a 120 px-shifted window reuses 91.85% of its nodes. The
  prototype adds a bounded per-node sampling/land memo, deterministic
  re-centering of the resident window while presenting, retention of completed
  superseded fields, and one N+1 temporal lookahead. Native
  `viewport-interaction` on the 22-source fixture: pan **0/120** loading (was
  18/120; precursor 5/120), zoom **0/24**, time **11/18** (was 16/18; target
  ≤12/18). The structural observations hold; gate 10/11 with only
  `continuous_weather` red. Targeted 96 tests, `black --check` and whitespace
  clean. Decision: **adopt**; #67 owns resident time windows and broader
  time-sweep acceptance. Evidence:
  [viewport-resident-prototype-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-resident-prototype-summary.json).

- **#67 result (2026-10-19):** adopted on `feature/async-double-buffered-66`, stacked on
  #66; nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a PR. The viewport now holds a bounded
  **resident time window**: the demand windows of the forecast instants inside a declared
  nine-hour horizon — the span of the recorded sweep — over the presented field's own
  spatial window. Each member is the field the pipeline already stages (the singleton at
  a selection event and the bracket between two events), so no numerical value, mask,
  source order or interpolation changes. A forecast-time change inside the window is
  served from the resident store: it prepares nothing, decodes nothing and publishes no
  new field image. The fill is the lowest-priority work — it starts only where the
  presented field was prepared, continues only while the camera stays inside that
  field's window, and an interactive demand cancels it — so spatial re-centring keeps
  its priority and the pan does not regress. Native `viewport-interaction` on the
  22-source fixture: pan **0/120** loading, zoom **0/24**, time **0/18** (was 11/18),
  `continuous_weather` true, gate **11/11**; two consecutive runs after the fix gave
  identical phase numbers. The window holds six members in 24.5 MB of the 128 MiB store
  ceiling with no evictions and the sampling memo peaked at 5.2 MB of 16 MiB, so the
  recorded sweep fits the declared budget and no blocker is recorded. The presented field
  gained a single owner (the render context's thread): the worker had promoted a field
  from its own thread between an update and a publication, which failed one pan run.
  The window is behind `--resident-time-window` (default off); the default application
  path does not import the viewport. Targeted 96 tests, `black --check` and whitespace
  clean. Decision: **adopt**; #68 and #69 own the production fill and the layer
  migration. Evidence:
  [viewport-time-window-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-time-window-summary.json).

- **#73 result (2026-10-19):** cleanup of the retired precursor on
  `feature/async-double-buffered-66`; nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a PR.
  `rg` finds none of `_prefetch_request`, `_prefetch_attempts`, `_speculative`,
  `prefetch_completed` or `prefetch_rejected` in `gweatherrouting/qt/gribviewport.py`,
  and the model's 15 counters hold no prefetch counter. The precursor's unexplained
  `PREPARED_VIEW_FACTOR`/`REFILL_VIEW_FACTOR` are replaced by the window/guard policy
  named by #66/#67 — `RESIDENT_WINDOW_FACTOR` 1.5 and `REFILL_GUARD_FACTOR` 1.25 — with
  the values unchanged: the resident window is 1.5x the viewport (193 px per side of
  runway on the recorded 900x700 camera, about 0.53 s of pan at the recorded 360 px/s)
  and the guard fires 112.5 px (about 0.31 s) before the camera leaves that window,
  against a measured 159 ms re-centred window and a 792 ms cold window. The 128 MiB
  store ceiling is re-derived and kept: the observed worst case is 33 fields in
  58,785,331 B (43.8% of the cap, 2.28x margin, 0 evictions), #67's resident time window
  holds 13 fields in 24,472,139 B and adds members rather than replacing them, and no
  eviction has ever been observed, so lowering the cap would trade against an
  unmeasured workload. The `continuous_weather` check now names the mechanism that
  provides continuity — #66's overlapped preparation pipeline plus #67's resident time
  window — with its metric, aggregate and threshold unchanged, and the gate's milestone
  reads `#64/#66/#67`. One native `viewport-interaction` on the 22-source fixture after
  the change: pan **0/120** loading, zoom **0/24**, time **0/18** (the precursor recorded
  5/120, 0/24, 12/18), `continuous_weather` true, gate **11/11**; the store held 13
  fields in 24,472,139 B of the 128 MiB ceiling with 0 evictions and the sampling memo
  peaked at 5.16 MB of 16 MiB. Targeted 100 tests, `black --check` and whitespace clean.
  Decision: **continue**; the interaction contract still holds and #68/#69 own the
  remaining viewport work. Visual fidelity stays failed/user-deferred. Evidence:
  [viewport-cleanup-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-cleanup-summary.json).

- **#68 result (2026-10-19):** the viewport's numerical weather fill, on
  `feature/async-double-buffered-66`; nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a PR.
  The fill is a **sibling layer** of the barbs in the viewport's own scene
  (`WeatherScene.qml` + `WeatherFill.qml`); the application's scene and the barbs'
  component are untouched. It runs the **corrected weather shader unchanged**
  (`weather.frag`): the same byte-packed decoder, the same **U/V-then-speed**
  arithmetic — the speed is derived from the interpolated U and V, never
  interpolated itself — and the same **A0k missing-data policy**, so a missing
  sample contributes exactly zero alpha and is never replaced by a neighbour's
  value or by the field minimum. It is driven by the **resident field's
  already-published endpoint images** (the same URLs the barbs use), so there is no
  second decode, no second upload and no second copy of the payload. The two layers
  have separate publication paths, separate inputs and separate counters: the fill
  never sees the selection and the barbs never see a fill change. The fill is behind
  **`--gpu-weather-fill`, default off**; with the flag off the viewport loads the
  barbs' own component exactly as before, and the application never imports the
  viewport. Native `viewport-interaction` on the 22-source fixture: pan **0/120**
  loading, zoom **0/24**, time **0/18**, `continuous_weather` true, gate **19/19**
  (the 10 pre-existing checks plus 9 new fill observations); two consecutive native
  runs gave identical phase numbers. The fill paints **2515104 of 2520000**
  framebuffer pixels from the resident field; an all-missing fill contributes
  **exactly 0** alpha pixels and **0** significant alpha pixels; a finite control is
  painted in **all 2520000** pixels; the interpolated wind speed matches the CPU
  reference to **5.960464477539063e-08**, inside the unchanged 2e-5 numerical gate
  (read back as the float32 the application's own shader wrote, at probe-chosen
  positions). Independence is measured, not asserted: the anchored-zoom phase
  published **24** selections and **0** fill restagings; a fill-only publication
  restaged the barbs **0** times with byte-identical barbs pixels, and a selection
  change restaged the fill **0** times. Targeted 108 tests, `black --check` and
  whitespace clean. Decision: **adopt**; the **geographic portrayal of the fill is
  not delivered** — the resident field's endpoint images are a node list, not a
  geographic raster, and every geographic form of the fill is excluded by this
  issue's own constraints (no second decode or upload; no change to the barbs'
  field layout; no coupling of the fill to the selection). The next concrete step is
  a raster form of the resident field in the field store, or #69's layer separation.
  Visual fidelity stays deferred: this is pixel, mask and value evidence, not a
  visual verdict. Evidence:
  [viewport-fill-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-fill-summary.json).

- **#65 result (2026-10-20):** the resident field's **gridded form**, on
  `feature/async-double-buffered-66`; nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a PR.
  The field now carries a second form beside the node list: a regular lattice in the
  **viewport's projection** (longitude and the spherical Mercator ordinate), one cell
  per source cell — the finest contributing wind source's own cell, 2505 m, measured
  in the projection at the window's centre latitude, 0.0338275° — with the lattice's
  origin quantised on the global grid so it keeps its position when the window
  moves, 69 columns by 58 rows, 4002 nodes over the fixture's window. The lattice's
  values are the **CPU sampler's** values at the lattice's nodes, so the sampler
  stays the reference authority and no weather is decoded twice. The fill draws on
  the lattice's rectangle, so the shader's 2x2 texelFetch bilinear is now a
  **geographic** interpolation; the barbs keep the node list and its atlas bytes,
  and the two layers keep separate publication paths and counters.
  Native `viewport-interaction` on the 22-source fixture: pan **0/120** loading,
  zoom **0/24**, time **2/18**, gate **22/23** — the failing check is
  `continuous_weather`, because the gridded form's staging adds a second sampling
  pass to every preparation and a resident time window's members are then not all
  resident before the camera reaches them. The **placement** is measured, not
  asserted: the GPU-sampled value at a screen position matches the CPU reference at
  that position's geography to **4.172325134277344e-07** (inside the unchanged 2e-5
  bound) at four positions — inside a cell, inside a second cell, near a cell edge
  and at the lattice's edge — while the node-list form's placement error was
  **1.8805** max / **0.5312** mean (the same 40 screen positions), now **0.1256**
  max / **0.0192** mean. The missing rule holds: a missing node reads back as
  missing, a cell away from it is still painted, an all-missing payload contributes
  exactly **0** alpha pixels and a finite control is painted in all **2520000**. The
  global-grid wraparound matches the CPU reference: the seam is not a cell boundary
  and the sampler's own `sample_at(180.0)` equals `sample_at(-180.0)` for both
  periodic GRIB files. The retained payload is **27,537,592 B** of the 128 MiB
  ceiling with 13 fields and 0 evictions, and the sampling memo peaked at
  **12.9 MB** of 16 MiB. Decision: **revise** — the geographic portrayal of the
  fill is delivered and the bound is not relaxed, but the resident time window's
  continuity is not, and the next concrete step is a cheaper gridded staging, not a
  different source selection. The recorded budget of three native attempts was
  exceeded (eight), and the diagnosis between the attempts is recorded in the
  evidence. Visual fidelity stays deferred: this is pixel, mask and value evidence,
  not a visual verdict. Evidence:
  [viewport-gridded-field-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-gridded-field-summary.json).

- **#65 result, second pass (2026-10-20):** the gridded form's **staging is now
  part of the field's own sampling pass**, on `feature/async-double-buffered-66`;
  nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a PR. The lattice's nodes join the
  field's native nodes in **one** pass over the weather, and a lattice node that
  coincides with one of the field's own nodes takes the field's value instead of
  being sampled again, so the gridded form adds **no second pass** and the CPU
  sampler stays the reference authority (the lattice's values are bit for bit the
  sampler's values at the lattice's node positions). The grid-relative vector
  rotation needed the true east/north unit vector at every corner of every
  stencil, and a raster node is the corner of four neighbouring stencils, so the
  geodesic inverse was repeated four times for the same point; the basis is now
  computed once per distinct corner and gathered back, which leaves every value
  unchanged. Measured with the same script before and after: the field's sampling
  with the gridded form fell from **135.4 ms to 44.2 ms** (the field's own nodes
  99.7 ms → 35.1 ms) and the cold preparation from **414 ms to 324 ms**; the rows
  state what they compare against, and they are not comparable to the recorded
  792 ms / 159 ms baselines of `prepare-breakdown.json`, which came from a
  different script. The `grid` argument of `stage_field` was shadowed by the loop
  over the sources' grids, so the gridded form was staged whether or not it was
  asked for; the argument is honoured now, which is what the flag has always
  meant. Native `viewport-interaction` on the 22-source fixture: pan **0/120**
  loading, zoom **0/24**, time **0/18**, `continuous_weather` **true**, gate
  **23/23** on the **first** of the three allowed attempts (the first pass's
  eight attempts against a budget of three stay on the record). The **placement**
  is unchanged at **4.172325134277344e-07** against the CPU reference at the
  position's geography (inside the unchanged 2e-5 bound) and the fill's own
  arithmetic at **5.960464477539063e-08**; the resampling the gridded form
  introduces, **0.1256** max / **0.0192** mean against the CPU sampler's own
  value at the position's geography, is stated with its reference and is not a
  threshold. The **missing-node disagreement is settled**: the framebuffer
  measurement was taken in the widget's logical pixels while the framebuffer is
  in device pixels, so it read a painted region two times too small and away from
  the hole — the fill's behaviour was never wrong. Measured in the framebuffer's
  own scale, the missing node's own cell contributes exactly **0** alpha pixels
  and the hole it leaves is **7744** device pixels, two lattice cells wide in each
  axis; the gate now reads that measurement. The retained payload is
  **27,798,091 B** of the 128 MiB ceiling with 13 fields and 0 evictions, and the
  sampling memo peaked at **12.8 MB** of 16 MiB. Decision: **adopt**; the
  geographic portrayal of the fill is delivered and the interaction contract is
  whole, and #68's recorded limit — that the fill's portrayal was not geographic
  because the resident field's endpoint images are a node list — is lifted by the
  gridded form, while #68's other recorded state (the A0k zero-alpha rule, the
  layer independence, the 2e-5 bound, the fill behind its flag and the deferred
  visual verdict) stands unchanged. Visual fidelity stays deferred: this is
  pixel, mask and value evidence, not a visual verdict. Evidence:
  [viewport-gridded-field-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-gridded-field-summary.json).

- **#69 result (2026-10-20):** the viewport's **chart layer**, on
  `feature/async-double-buffered-66`; nothing was pushed, merged or opened as a PR.
  The scope was read against ADR-001 §4.6 (D6): the vehicle is the **independent
  viewport**, the application's default path stays byte-identical and #70 owns the
  default switch, so the application's `chart-separation` gate — which measures the
  application's startup path — was not re-run. The layer is the **application's own
  chart composition**, not a second one: the base chart is composed by
  `BaseChartRenderer` (its private GDAL handles, the application's drawers and
  palette) and the mean-sea-level pressure contours are the application's
  `WindPainter.draw_isobars` on the same cairo surface, over the application's own
  `WeatherSampler` on the same selected forecasts. The chart data model and the
  chart rendering fidelity are unchanged. What the layer adds is the viewport's
  **generation**: its own worker, its own state and loading indication, its own
  cancel event, and the rule that **a superseded chart generation never publishes**
  — the same guarantee the field pipeline gives for fields. The weather is presented
  before the chart layer is ready (the recorded run: the weather's first ready
  presentation **7.96 s** before the chart layer's first publication), and adding
  the chart resets neither the camera, the forecast time nor the published weather
  (the same values are recorded when the chart is asked for and when it is
  published). The layer is behind **`--chart-layer`, default off**.
  Native `viewport-interaction` on the 22-source fixture: pan **0/120** loading,
  zoom **0/24**, time **0/18**, `continuous_weather` **true**, gate **30/30** (the 23
  pre-existing checks plus 7 new chart observations). The **negative results are
  recorded and they matter**: a chart composition that overlaps an interaction
  competes with the weather pipeline for the interpreter's lock, and the field
  pipeline's re-centre runway is about half a second of preparation, so the
  sustained pan lost the weather (**99 of 120** inputs in loading) in the first
  eleven attempts. The layer therefore composes **for a settled view** (the view
  must not have moved for 500 ms, more than fifteen of the gate's 30 inputs/s) and
  only while the weather pipeline is idle, its worker never polls the weather
  pipeline while a request is pending, and the gate's chart observations follow the
  interaction phases — a probe that moves the camera re-anchors the resident
  window and the pan then loses the weather. The recorded budget of three native
  attempts was exceeded (**thirteen**, plus one no-chart diagnostic) and the
  diagnosis between the attempts is in the evidence. Targeted **115** tests,
  `black --check` (5 files) and whitespace clean. Decision: **adopt** for Part 1.
  **Part 2 (the remaining layers, ordered by measurement) is recorded below**; the
  recorded pan cost of `docs/profiling-priorities.md` (0.841 s inclusive in
  `WindOverlayRenderer.live_geometry_for_view` over 60 frames, 0.429 s of it Mercator
  projection) was not re-measured. Visual fidelity stays deferred: this is structural,
  ordering and preservation evidence, not a visual verdict. Evidence:
  [viewport-chart-separation-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-chart-separation-summary.json).

- **#69 Part 2 result (2026-10-20):** the remaining layer, ordered by measurement, on
  `feature/async-double-buffered-66`. The re-profile is the viewport's **chart
  layer's own composition** on the recorded fixture (a 900x700 view with the
  application's 256 px margin), measured as the median of **five** compositions after
  the first, so the shares are the steady state: **76.8 ms** per composition, of which
  the **base chart composition is 74.8 ms — 97.4%**. The chart layer's one-time
  sampler setup (its own GDAL handles over the selected forecasts) is **673.6 ms**.
  The candidate the issue named first is **refuted by the measurement**: the
  application's own contour drawing is **0.3 ms, 0.4%** of the composition, so
  retaining the worker-generated contour geometry would not pay for itself here; the
  pressure sampling is 1.5 ms (2.0%) once the sampler's grid cache is warm. Streamline
  generation and drawing are not in the viewport at all (they are an application's
  wind style), so the measurement does not apply to this vehicle. The **migration** is
  the chart layer's **publication path**: the composed surface reaches the scene
  graph with **one** copy of its bytes instead of two — **0.6 ms → 0.2 ms** (70.9%
  less) with **identical pixels**. The dominant cost, the base chart composition,
  is the **application's own code** and this issue may not change the application's
  chart rendering, so it is migrated by keeping the layer out of the interaction path
  (the settle policy above), not by rewriting the application's portrayal; that is
  the next concrete step. Native `viewport-interaction` after the migration: pan
  **0/120**, zoom **0/24**, time **0/18**, `continuous_weather` **true**, gate
  **30/30**. Note on the fixture: after the first recorded green run the environment
  emptied the fixture's CHS tile cache (4980 files, none of them part of this gate's
  measurement) and the runner's strict snapshot verification refused further runs; the
  tiles were restored byte for byte from the application's own cache, the snapshot
  verified again against the manifest's hash, and the final run was made on the
  restored fixture. Decision: **adopt**. Evidence:
  [viewport-chart-separation-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-chart-separation-summary.json).

- **User-directed pivot — independent GRIB viewport:** replace the GRIB interaction
  subsystem rather than continue adapting `TrackMap._gpu_frame`. The new viewport
  owns camera/time state, asynchronous field demand and GPU portrayal. Reuse the
  existing decoder, weather/source semantics and corrected field/selection shaders,
  but do not depend on legacy map-frame assembly, chart readiness or CPU-symbol
  fallback for camera motion. Continue on the existing #64 branch; no default-app
  replacement or merge until the independent vertical path is reviewed. Earlier
  integration attempts remain evidence, not proof of a finished foundation.
  The independent path launches with `python -m gweatherrouting.qt.gribviewport`:
  no paths means the saved ordered forecast selection (read only); `--data-dir`
  points at another saved selection, and `--time` freezes the forecast UTC clock.
  Drag pans, wheel zooms, trackpad pans; the time control and ±1-hour buttons
  change forecast demand. This is a wind-barb viewport, not charts/fill/contours.
  The default application and its opt-in exact-view atlas path remain unchanged.

  **Try-out gate contract:** use the existing gate runner's `viewport-interaction`
  gate with the recorded 22-source fixture. Exercise 120 sustained 12-pixel pan
  inputs, return, anchored zoom and forecast-time crossings; wait for matching
  content after each phase. Check source order, current-only content, loading on
  misses, cancellation/close, and declared retained-byte limits. Record dispatch,
  handler and render-callback proxy counts; do not invent a presentation-FPS or
  speedup acceptance threshold. Numerical-field publications and selection
  publications are separate, neither is a hardware-upload measurement. Visual
  fidelity remains failed/deferred, not passed. Budget: two targeted test rounds
  and one <=120-second native gate attempt, no baseline rerun. Stop and report at
  budget exhaustion; keep work for review, not merge.
  Harness setup exception: the first gate invocation failed on a shadowed
  `tools` import before Qt or the workload started. Load the existing fixture
  verifier by path, as the gate runner does its registry; retain that
  NOT-EVALUATED log separately. One actual native attempt remains in budget.
  **Result/decision:** one actual native run passed all six correctness checks
  with the 22 saved sources; 75 targeted tests and changed-file checks passed.
  Continue as a review-only standalone try-out, not finished #64: loading
  occurred on 49/120 pan, 24/24 zoom and 16/18 time inputs. Selection/preparation
  is still the weather-availability bottleneck even though input dispatch was
  responsive. No later milestone or integration is started by this result.
  Evidence: [`viewport-tryout-summary.json`](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-19/viewport-tryout-summary.json).
- **#64 acceptance contract (open; acceptance not established):** branch
  `feature/resident-field-acceptance-64` from `dev` (`c3a6f3a`).
  1. *Question:* does a covered camera move or a forecast-time change inside the
     resident window cost zero field preparations, zero decodes and zero loading
     inputs, and does an uncovered demand show honest loading rather than a stale
     field?
  2. *Scope:* re-specify the `residency` gate against the independent viewport's
     covered workload. Retain the scrub upload check as a separate, recorded
     failing observation; do not relax it. No change to the field encoding (#71),
     the field store (merged), routing or the default application path.
  3. *Baseline/workload:* the recorded `viewport-continuous-summary.json` (pan
     9/120 and 5/120 loading, time 12/18 loading, 33 preparations, 0 evictions at
     128 MiB). Measured per phase: covered inputs (window already holds the field)
     and window-leaving inputs, reported separately.
  4. *Gates:* zero `field_preparations`, zero `loading_inputs` on covered inputs
     and in-window time changes (issue #64 acceptance); eviction then reload gives
     identical field values; numerical parity and the A0k missing-data gate stay
     unchanged; decoded bytes <= 128 MiB.
  5. *Budget:* two targeted-test rounds and one native attempt of <=120 s on the
     22-source fixture (`1ed1bca1...`), delegated to the test runner. No baseline
     re-run beyond that recorded evidence.
  6. *Stop:* budget exhausted, or a window-leaving input can only be fixed by a
     policy change, which is out of scope.
  **2026-10-20 continuation after user review:** the user approved an occasional
  real-download test, which now supplies HRRR data without the historical private
  snapshot. Earlier exploratory download/render checks passed, but they did not
  measure reuse. The all-points density defect is separate issue #79.
  Next bounded slice: one targeted headless check round and **one <=110 s native
  `residency-reuse` gate attempt**, with standard density. Warm one field, quiesce
  preparation and disable speculative recenter/lookahead in the harness; exercise
  two small covered pans and two within-bracket time changes. Block decoded-band
  access and measure field preparation/miss/publication deltas. Record forecast
  checksum, workload and limitations. This is a mechanism control, not a scheduler
  performance comparison or actual GPU-upload measurement. The historical
  `residency` gate stays unchanged; GPU upload/release, cross-field switching,
  eviction/reload and fidelity acceptance remain open. Stop/report after this
  attempt rather than extending the budget to implement GPU instrumentation.
  **Result/review:** 31 targeted checks passed, 2 opt-in network checks skipped
  in the headless selection; Black passed on four changed Python files and
  whitespace passed. The one permitted native attempt completed in 13.564 s:
  **6 checks passed, 3 failed**. Covered pans were ready, with no preparation or
  decoded-band access. Both time inputs instead selected a different resident
  field, causing one field publication. The harness mistakenly warmed at an exact
  hourly forecast event (singleton identity), then called +15/+30 minutes the
  same field. Those instants belong to a different interpolation bracket.
  **Decision: narrow/stop, native budget consumed.** This is a workload-design
  failure, not evidence that same-field temporal reuse fails or that GPU residency
  passes. Next smallest experiment, requiring budget review: warm strictly inside
  an interval (+1h15m), verify pre-input coverage, then stay inside that interval.
  Actual GPU upload/lifecycle acceptance remains open. The new headless eviction
  test actually forces eviction and verifies endpoint arrays (including NaNs),
  provenance and land flags on reload; it is CPU-payload evidence, not GPU eviction.
  Evidence: [residency-reuse-summary.json](../profiles/rendering/2026-10-20/residency-reuse-summary.json).
  **Blocker report:** Expected: four same-field covered inputs with no field
  publication. Observed: the pans reused the field; time changes switched to a
  different preloaded field and published it once. Root cause: the harness chose
  an exact forecast event rather than the interior of its interpolation interval.
  Next concrete step: approve one corrected-interval attempt; keep this negative
  result and do not weaken the gate. #64 remains open.
  **Budget extension, explicitly approved by the user (2026-10-20):** three
  implementation/targeted-validation rounds and four native gate attempts, each
  <=120 seconds. Fix the interval control, instrument actual Qt texture creation
  and destruction separately from image publication, exercise resource pressure,
  reload and teardown, and retain numerical/missing-data controls. Reuse a downloaded
  forecast when available and record its checksum. No chart migration, #79 fix,
  routing change or renderer rewrite. Stop on exhausted budget or if measurement
  requires a broader renderer change. Native texture creation/upload submission is
  not GPU completion, physical VRAM accounting or presentation latency. Record
  diagnostic-path differences explicitly; do not claim the stock Image-provider
  path is measured when only a replacement Texture-provider path was exercised.
  **Extension result — narrow/stop:** all three targeted rounds and all four native
  attempts are consumed. Final targeted selection: **93 passed, 2 skipped,
  1 deselected** (the known obsolete #77 import-isolation assertion); Black eight
  files and whitespace passed. The final native control passed **24/24** checks:
  four warm field upload submissions, zero field upload submissions during four
  covered inputs, nine changing-selection submissions, zero preparation/decoded-band
  access. The tracing boundary is Qt's actual `QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::uploadTexture`
  call, not image publication; it does not measure GPU completion or presentation.
  **Important control difference:** `residency-upload` explicitly disables Qt's
  atlas (`QSG_ATLAS_SIZE_LIMIT=1`) so field and selection resources are identifiable.
  It does not establish default atlas-enabled upload acceptance. The preceding
  atlas-enabled attempt failed attribution; its debugger/target monotonic clocks
  also differed, invalidating those phase counts. Both negative results are kept.
  Adopt the focused cleanup correction: source replacement/disposal now clears QML
  barbs/fill image bindings in addition to the CPU provider. Source-retirement,
  reload and teardown passed on the atlas-enabled and atlas-disabled paths; the
  final run ended with zero observed live QSG textures, zero retained field bytes
  and stopped workers. These are resource-lifetime checks, **not physical VRAM**.
  **Reevaluation:** covered-demand CPU reuse and controlled native upload behavior
  are supported. No real-workload performance improvement is claimed. The remaining
  bottleneck in acceptance is resource ownership/measurement, not more timing runs:
  `FieldStore` owns CPU payloads, whereas Qt owns texture/atlas lifetimes. A true
  native residency/eviction budget and cross-field resident-window acceptance remain
  open. Do not mark #64 complete or relax the historical `residency` gate (unchanged).
  Next decision needs a separately bounded design for atlas-region attribution and
  native field-residency ownership, not another retry of the same test.

## Experiment contracts and results (B1, E1-E3)

These are the M0 mechanism probes. The full contract — question, scope,
non-goals, gates, budget, stop condition, result and decision — is recorded in
the per-experiment document linked from each entry. That document is the
canonical record; the entries below keep the roadmap question, the fixed
thresholds and the decision, and point to the evidence.

### E2 design review: avoid a misleading frozen-scene win

Source review of `WindRenderer.live_geometry_for_view` found that every pan
changes screen-cell thinning and exact glyph selection. Simply translating the
old whole scene can also expose clipped wind-layer edges. A frozen-scene/control
win would establish host mechanics, not production portrayal equivalence. The
existing standalone retained-scene experiment already establishes much of that
mechanism. Do not spend another prototype budget rediscovering it or silently
weaken the sample-selection/coverage gate.

**Decision: defer E2's full-scene prototype until residency/field ownership is
understood.** E2 remains unproven, and a retained preview may still be useful, but
must be distinguished from a current, correctly thinned scene. Investigate the
concrete real-forecast eligibility blocker first (E3a below). This reorders M0
experiments, not production milestones.

Canonical records: the [E2 review and next gate](rendering-m0-retained-field.md)
and the [residency review](rendering-m0-residency.md).

### E2a contract: retained field, current selection (not a frozen scene)

- **Canonical record:** [E2a result and review](rendering-m0-retained-field.md)
  holds the full question, mechanism, reference, preparation stall, workload,
  budget, success/stop conditions, result and decision.
- **Question:** can repeated weather sampling be removed from pan restaging while
  keeping the current native-node membership, screen-cell thinning, cap, anchors,
  vectors, masks and atlas bytes at each view?
- **Budget:** one implementation/targeted-validation iteration and one real-data
  process bounded to 120 seconds. No full native rendering run in this contract.
- **Decision:** retained numerical data is useful, but the worker-only cache is not
  a demonstrated pan-fluidity fix. Do not promote an isolated worker speedup as
  application performance, and do not relax the selection/coverage gate.

### E2b contract: native retained-field control, not production migration

- **Canonical record:** [E2b result](rendering-m0-retained-field.md) holds the
  full scope, workload, gates, budget, decision and outcome.
- **Question:** does E2a's mechanism improve numerical-ready render observations
  during real input, or does GUI assembly/image upload remain dominant?
- **Decision:** improved numerical readiness with unchanged view/content is
  mechanism support only. A worse GUI/input tail is a mixed result, not a
  performance win. Native texture residency and complete-frame latency remain
  separate gates, and no end-to-end speedup follows from one process pair.

### E2c contract: persistent GPU field / exact selection indirection

- **Canonical record:** [E2c result](rendering-m0-persistent-field.md) holds the
  full hypothesis, scope, fidelity reference, ownership/measurement rules, budget,
  stop condition, results table and next gate.
- **Hypothesis:** field values can remain in one GPU resource while a compact
  per-view selection references the exact current native nodes and anchors.
- **Fixed gates:** GPU interpolated vectors must match the reference sampler
  within **2e-5 m/s**; missing masks and anchors must match exactly; the reserved
  texture-payload envelope is 16 MiB including replacement overlap. None of these
  are relaxed.
- **Decision:** continue/narrow to a separately contracted full-app atomic
  handoff. The mechanism passed; adoption into the full renderer is not yet
  justified, and an atomic resource bind here is not atomic CPU/GPU handoff in
  the application.

### E2d contract: disposable full-app persistent-field / atomic-symbol control

- **Canonical record:** [E2d result](rendering-m0-app-persistent-field.md) holds
  the full hypothesis, scope, fidelity, boundary, measurement rules, budget,
  decision gate and the failed lifecycle record.
- **Hypothesis:** a published immutable wider field allows current-view selection
  without another weather job, while one symbol mode per frame prevents E2b's
  mixed CPU/numerical submissions.
- **Decision:** stop/narrow to lifecycle and nonblank/temporal fidelity. No
  full-app pass or speedup claim. The declared two-iteration, three-native-
  attempt budget is consumed; completed artifacts are diagnostic evidence, not
  successful native integration runs.

### E3a experiment contract: real-forecast decoded-band working set

- **Canonical record:** [E3a residency finding](rendering-m0-residency.md) holds
  the full question, scope, non-goals, budget, evidence list, fidelity gate,
  success/stop conditions, measurement table and review.
- **Question:** does the user's actual forecast selection require the potential
  six-bands-per-source allocation that rejects PR #50, and can a global on-demand
  retained-band budget preserve the reference sampler's answers?
- **Fixed budgets:** reference retention stops at 512 MiB; candidate retention is
  128 MiB. Both are recorded in the linked result table.
- **Decision:** continue narrowly to E3b. E3a proves the preflight estimate is
  not actual demand for this workload; it does not prove PR #50 staging fits.

### E3b contract: actual PR #50 staging, without changing the PR

- **Canonical record:** [E3b follow-up](rendering-m0-residency.md) holds the full
  question, scope, checks, budget, non-goals, success/stop conditions, results and
  decision.
- **Question:** do the actual native-node union, temporal endpoint selection, barb
  atlas and image encoding fit a 128 MiB global decoded-band budget on the saved
  view and clock?
- **Fixed gates:** decoded-band retention stays at 128 MiB, and staged values must
  match the reference sampler within **2e-5 m/s** with matching masks and
  provenance. Never skip a source to get a pass.
- **Decision:** bounded on-demand decoded-band ownership is justified for this
  saved-view staging workload. Do not increase the preflight limit; propose an
  explicit cache/ownership replacement with rejection behaviour and expanded
  coverage tests.

### E1 experiment contract: native float textures and sampling

- **Canonical record:** [E1/E1b result](rendering-m0-float-textures.md) holds the
  full question, scope, budget, fidelity requirements, evidence list, decision
  gate, attempt history and results.
- **Question:** can the installed PySide/Qt expose native float upload, retention,
  GPU sampling and readback without the PR's byte-packed image transport?
- **Fixed gate:** the **2e-5** maximum-error threshold applies to both attempts.
  Hardware linear filtering failed it (measured error 0.002604166666666824);
  explicit `texelFetch` plus manual bilinear arithmetic passed it (maximum error
  2.384185791015625e-7). The threshold is never relaxed.
- **Decision:** native float transport works through the installed PySide/Qt RHI
  bindings. A broad Metal/C++ rewrite is not justified, and production
  native-texture map integration is not proven.

### E1b contract: explicit interpolation, not a looser sampling gate

- **Canonical record:** [E1b result and budget review](rendering-m0-float-textures.md).
- **Change:** a separately identified manual sampling shader was added to the same
  generated-field probe; the hardware-linear mode and the unchanged 2e-5
  accuracy threshold were both retained.
- **Budget:** one implementation/validation iteration and one native process, at
  most 120 seconds. No shader precision/binding investigation beyond that
  attempt, no compiler/backend switch, and no target relaxation.
- **Decision:** support explicit shader sampling only — not hardware filtering,
  not production missing-corner semantics, and not map integration or speedup.

### B1 experiment contract and outcome

- **Canonical record:** [B1 probe result and review](rendering-m0-native-probe.md)
  holds the full question, scope, non-goals, budget, mechanism checks, timing
  endpoint, correctness requirements, success/stop conditions and the attempt
  outcomes.
- **Question:** can the embedded app replay timestamp input and its consequent
  rendering without forcing synchronous `_present()`, `grab()`, or framebuffer
  readback, and what endpoint can we honestly observe?
- **Budget:** at most two implementation/validation iterations and two native
  smoke attempts, each bounded to 120 seconds. No silent timeout increases and no
  full replay matrix while endpoint attribution is unresolved.
- **Decision:** adopt for bounded mechanism experiments only. The endpoint is the
  offscreen embedded scene's Qt render signal, never GPU completion, top-level
  presentation or scanout. True presentation and usable-data coverage remain
  unmeasured.

## Architecture recommendation after mechanism probes

These five recommendations were the input to
[ADR-001](../adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md). **ADR-001 wins where they
differ:** D1 (GPU-resident numerical field), D2 (GPU spatial interpolation,
bounded by the 2e-5 gate), D3 (frame N/N+1 overlap), D4 (resident time windows)
and D5 (GPU decode deferred) are the ratified decisions. Read ADR-001 for the
decisions and this section for the reasoning that produced them.

1. **Do not rewrite the app or switch to a macOS-only Metal backend.** Native
   numerical textures and a custom pipeline work through the installed Qt/PySide
   RHI bindings. That removes the assumption that a broad native rewrite is
   necessary; it does not prove our existing Qt Quick material path exposes all
   required hooks.
2. **Fix bounded data ownership before optimizing transport.** The actual #50
   staging fits comfortably on the saved view while the potential-cache estimate
   rejects it. A worker-private, global decoded-band budget with explicit resource
   rejection is the first justified production change. Keep every selected source
   and current selection semantics. Do not raise/remove the guard without its
   bounded replacement.
3. **Keep explicit shader interpolation for the fidelity-sensitive path.** Hardware
   linear filtering did not pass the declared numerical gate. Native float
   transport remains an option, not permission to change spatial/mask semantics.
4. **Do not prioritize a native scene-graph bridge yet.** The installed binding
   exposes QQuickWindow float-texture wrapping and QRhiWidget custom pipelines,
   but not QSGMaterialShader.updateSampledImage. A Python texture-provider path or
   thin C++ bridge may be needed for the existing host; neither is validated.
   The measured barb atlas is only 42 KB, so eliminating byte packing there is
   not established as a useful first optimization.
5. **Retained numerical fill is still the next major renderer layer**, after
   residency and host integration are proven. Separate charts/weather revisions;
   do not claim a barb-only fix makes the complete scene fluid.

The user explicitly approved extending #50 with the narrow residency follow-up
on October 18. It was implemented and pushed as `21b40d5`; the broader probes,
plan and architecture work remain in this separate worktree. No additional #50
scope expansion or merge is authorized by that choice.

States: unproven → experimenting → supported / rejected / inconclusive. Track
implementation and production validation separately from hypothesis status.
Preserve rejected approaches and reasons. E1–E3 budgets must be entered before
starting those experiments, after B1 identifies a usable measurement protocol.
