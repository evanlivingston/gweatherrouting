# Documentation index

**The architecture decision is [ADR-001](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md).
The work program that implements it is epic #51, issues
[#62–#70](milestones.md).** Read ADR-001 first, then work one issue at a time.

This directory has three parts, and each part answers a different question:

| Part | Contents | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| This file and the five documents below it | the current decision, roadmap, spec and issue index | **You are starting or doing work.** |
| The other `docs/*.md` files | reference for how the application behaves today | You need the current behaviour of a specific area |
| [`history/`](history/) | completed-work records and experiment evidence, including every rejected result | You need to know *why* a decision was made, or what was already tried |
| [`profiles/`](profiles/) | machine-readable recorded results | You need a number; do not re-measure it |
## Start here

Read these five, in this order, and nothing else until you need more:

1. **[ADR-001](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md)** — the accepted architecture
   decision (D1–D5), the disposition of the seven structural gaps, and the
   mapping onto issues #62–#70.
2. **[`rendering-performance-plan.md`](rendering-performance-plan.md)** — the
   canonical roadmap: current checkpoint, hypothesis ledger, milestone status and
   the A0 decision log.
3. **[`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md)** — the
   R0–R5 sequence, the layer/ownership model, the non-negotiable invariants and
   the measurement contract.
4. **[`milestones.md`](milestones.md)** — the issue index for #62–#70.
5. Your issue's own body, which states its gate, evidence and validation command.

Everything else in this directory is either background you may not need, or
evidence for a decision that has already been made.

## History

[`history/`](history/) holds 28 records of work that is finished and decisions
already made. They are preserved because the repository's rules require it:
rejected approaches and their reasons are evidence, and historical reports are
never overwritten with candidate results.

**Read them only to find out why a decision was made or what was already
tried.** Every file there opens with a status header saying what it is, when it
was written and what supersedes it. None of them is a plan, and no A0 slice may
be started from one.

## Machine-readable evidence and research code

| Path | Status | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`../tools/gate_runner.py`](../tools/gate_runner.py) and [`../tools/gates.py`](../tools/gates.py) | `CANONICAL` | The performance gate runner and its registry. One command gates a rendering change against the acceptance thresholds, with each threshold's recorded-evidence provenance kept in the registry. See the "Performance gate runner" section of the [root README](../README.md). |
| [`profiles/rendering/`](profiles/rendering/) | `REFERENCE` | Recorded machine-readable experiment results. These are the reference baselines — do not re-measure or edit them. |
| [`profiles/2026-10-12/`](profiles/2026-10-12/) | `REFERENCE` | The recorded routing/profile run for 2026-10-12. |
| [`../research/gpu-weather-texture/`](../research/gpu-weather-texture/) | `EXPERIMENT` | Archived experiment: pre-computing each forecast hour's U/V bands as GPU textures so a time change becomes a texture lookup. Never merged, never imported by the application, and unmeasured. It is prior art for ADR-001 D4 (resident time windows). |
| [`source/`](source/) | `REFERENCE` | The Sphinx source for the published user documentation, separate from this index. |
