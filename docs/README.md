# Documentation index

**The architecture decision is [ADR-001](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md).
The work program that implements it is epic #51, issues
[#62–#70](milestones.md).** Read ADR-001 first, then work one issue at a time.

This file is the index for `docs/`. It says which document is authoritative,
which is background, and which is a historical experiment record. It does not
replace any of them.

## Status labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CANONICAL` | Authoritative. Read this one; other documents defer to it. |
| `REFERENCE` | Accurate background. Read it if it is relevant to your change. |
| `HISTORICAL` | Experiment record or superseded document. Read it for evidence; do not follow it as a plan. |
| `EXPERIMENT` | Research code, not shipped. Not imported by the application. |

## Architecture, roadmap and program

| Document | Status | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md`](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md) | `CANONICAL` | The accepted architecture decision: D1–D5, the disposition of the seven structural gaps, the amendments to the R0–R5 spec, and the mapping to issues #62–#70. Read this first. |
| [`rendering-performance-plan.md`](rendering-performance-plan.md) | `CANONICAL` | The canonical performance roadmap: current checkpoint, reference workload, milestones, hypothesis ledger, experiment-contract index and the A0 decision log. |
| [`rendering-implementation-plan.md`](rendering-implementation-plan.md) | `CANONICAL` | The detailed R0–R5 implementation sequence, layer/ownership model, non-negotiable invariants and measurement contract, as amended by ADR-001 §6. |
| [`milestones.md`](milestones.md) | `CANONICAL` | Local index of epic #51 and issues #62–#70 with milestone and dependency columns. GitHub remains the authoritative tracker. |
| [`grib-architecture-analysis.md`](grib-architecture-analysis.md) | `REFERENCE` | Current-state GRIB loading and visualization architecture with file/line citations, and the seven structural gaps ADR-001 disposes of. Evidence, not a plan. |
| [`../tools/gate_runner.py`](../tools/gate_runner.py) and [`../tools/gates.py`](../tools/gates.py) | `CANONICAL` | The performance gate runner and its registry. One command gates a rendering change against the acceptance thresholds. See the "Performance gate runner" section of the [root README](../README.md). |
| [`luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md`](luckgrib-architecture-analysis.md) | `REFERENCE` | Reference techniques T1–T8 from a read-only analysis of a locally installed LuckGrib build. A hypothesis source, not a benchmark and not implementation source. |
| [`profiling-priorities.md`](profiling-priorities.md) | `REFERENCE` | Already-measured cost slices and their limits. Do not re-measure what is recorded here. |
| [`rendering-m0-measurement-audit.md`](rendering-m0-measurement-audit.md) | `REFERENCE` | Source audit of what the instrumentation can and cannot prove, and why readback is not presentation. |

## Start-up and application lifecycle

| Document | Status | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`early-weather-startup.md`](early-weather-startup.md) | `REFERENCE` | How to run the opt-in `--early-weather` start-up, and what it does and does not change. |
| [`early-weather-startup-integration.md`](early-weather-startup-integration.md) | `HISTORICAL` | The M0/A0l integration checkpoint for opt-in early-weather start-up. Superseded by ADR-001 and the issue program. |

## Rendering evidence — historical experiment records

These are the evidence base the repository's rules depend on ("preserve rejected
approaches and reasons", "historical reports must not be overwritten"). Read them
for the results; do not follow them as a plan.

| Document | Status | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`rendering-architecture-evaluation.md`](rendering-architecture-evaluation.md) | `HISTORICAL` | The A0a–A0k experiment record, including every negative result. The authoritative narrative for the A0 program. |
| [`rendering-a0g-progress.md`](rendering-a0g-progress.md) | `HISTORICAL` | A0g: unattended continuation — persistent new-area loading, honest partial coverage, reference-empty wind, native A→B→A publication. |
| [`rendering-a0h-resident-worker.md`](rendering-a0h-resident-worker.md) | `HISTORICAL` | A0h: single-owner resident numerical worker with deferred fidelity checks and matched timing. |
| [`rendering-a0i-independent-numerical.md`](rendering-a0i-independent-numerical.md) | `HISTORICAL` | A0i: numerical startup independent of the chart application, and the authorized fixture rebaseline. |
| [`rendering-a0j-early-display.md`](rendering-a0j-early-display.md) | `HISTORICAL` | A0j: early weather publication while the chart host starts. Mechanism passed; visual acceptance blocked and later repaired by A0k. |
| [`rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md`](rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md) | `HISTORICAL` | A0k: the missing-data shader repair and its zero-alpha gate. The corrected renderer, not the original, is the reference for missing-data portrayal. |
| [`rendering-m0-native-probe.md`](rendering-m0-native-probe.md) | `HISTORICAL` | B1: the embedded non-readback timing probe. A render-signal proxy, not presentation measurement. |
| [`rendering-m0-float-textures.md`](rendering-m0-float-textures.md) | `HISTORICAL` | E1/E1b: native float transport. Hardware filtering failed the 2e-5 gate; explicit shader arithmetic passed it. |
| [`rendering-m0-residency.md`](rendering-m0-residency.md) | `HISTORICAL` | E3a/E3b: decoded-band residency and the actual PR #50 staging workload. |
| [`rendering-m0-retained-field.md`](rendering-m0-retained-field.md) | `HISTORICAL` | E2a/E2b: retained field versus native interaction. The worker-only cache is not a demonstrated pan-fluidity fix. |
| [`rendering-m0-persistent-field.md`](rendering-m0-persistent-field.md) | `HISTORICAL` | E2c: persistent numerical field with exact selection indirection. |
| [`rendering-m0-app-persistent-field.md`](rendering-m0-app-persistent-field.md) | `HISTORICAL` | E2d: the disposable full-app persistent-field control. Lifecycle gate failed; the artifacts are diagnostic evidence only. |
| [`gpu-rendering-experiment.md`](gpu-rendering-experiment.md) | `HISTORICAL` | The 2026-10-15 GPU feasibility experiment, including the reproduced fractional-pan composite failures. |
| [`gpu-texture-parity-r0.1.md`](gpu-texture-parity-r0.1.md) | `HISTORICAL` | R0.1: the texture-parity fix for the reproduced 2× Metal failures, with the unchanged quality gates. |
| [`gpu-weather-residency.md`](gpu-weather-residency.md) | `HISTORICAL` | PR #50: the bounded worker-private decoded-band residency change, now merged to `dev` as `b9e2471` via PR #61 `1a90515`. |
| [`rendering-baseline-2026-10-15.md`](rendering-baseline-2026-10-15.md) | `HISTORICAL` | The synthetic scaling baseline. The startup baseline, not this one, is the optimization priority for the installed app. |
| [`rendering-performance.md`](rendering-performance.md) | `HISTORICAL` | The historical benchmark protocol and its gate values. The canonical roadmap is `rendering-performance-plan.md`. |
| [`routing-profile-2026-10-12.md`](routing-profile-2026-10-12.md) | `HISTORICAL` | The dated routing profile and the first optimization targets it identified. |

## Machine-readable evidence and research code

| Path | Status | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Superseded documents

If you land on one of these, it is evidence, not a plan. The current thinking is
in [ADR-001](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md) and the issue program
(#62–#70, indexed in [`milestones.md`](milestones.md)).

| Superseded document | Superseded by |

| [`rendering-a0g-progress.md`](rendering-a0g-progress.md) … [`rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md`](rendering-a0k-shader-safety.md) | ADR-001; the A0 program is closed as an experiment |

Nothing in this list has been deleted. They are the evidence base the
repository's rules depend on: rejected approaches and their reasons are
preserved, and historical reports are never overwritten with candidate results.
