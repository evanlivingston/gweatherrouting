# Documentation index

**The architecture decision is [ADR-001](adr-001-grib-rendering-architecture.md);
its work program is epic #51, issues [#62-#73](milestones.md).**

**The issue body is the spec for a task.** It states the gap, scope, non-goals,
acceptance gate and validation command. Read a document from this index only
when the issue body points at it.

| Part | Contents | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| This file | the router: one line per document | You need to locate a document |
| [`history/`](history/) | completed-work records and experiment evidence, including every rejected result | You need to know *why* a decision was made, or what was already tried |
| [`profiles/`](profiles/) | machine-readable recorded results | You need a number; do not re-measure it |

## Status labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CANONICAL` | Authoritative. Read this one; other documents defer to it. |
| `REFERENCE` | Accurate background. Read it if it is relevant to your change. |
| `HISTORICAL` | Experiment record or completed work. Read it for evidence; do not follow it as a plan. |
| `EXPERIMENT` | Research code, not shipped. Not imported by the application. |

## History

[`history/`](history/) holds the completed-work records and experiment
evidence, including every rejected result. They are preserved because the
repository's rules require it: rejected approaches and their reasons are
evidence, and historical reports are never overwritten with candidate results.

**Read them only to find out why a decision was made or what was already
tried.** Every file there opens with a status header saying what it is, when it
was written and what supersedes it. None of them is a plan, and no slice may be
started from one.

The two consolidated records from the rendering program are
[`history/rendering-decision-log.md`](history/rendering-decision-log.md) (the
archived checkpoint notes, the consolidation notes, the #51 acceptance
checkpoint and the A0 decision log) and
[`history/rendering-experiment-records.md`](history/rendering-experiment-records.md)
(the runtime integration record and the M0 experiment contracts B1, E1-E3).
The rest are the per-slice reports.

## Machine-readable evidence and research code

| Path | Status | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`../tools/gate_runner.py`](../tools/gate_runner.py) and [`../tools/gates.py`](../tools/gates.py) | `CANONICAL` | The performance gate runner and its registry. One command gates a rendering change against the acceptance thresholds, with each threshold's recorded-evidence provenance kept in the registry. See the "Performance gate runner" section of the [root README](../README.md). |
| [`../tools/check_doc_links.py`](../tools/check_doc_links.py) and [`../tools/check_doc_anchors.py`](../tools/check_doc_anchors.py) | `CANONICAL` | The documentation checkers. The first verifies that local link targets exist; the second verifies that `#anchor` fragments match a heading in the target file. Run both after any documentation change. |
| [`profiles/rendering/`](profiles/rendering/) | `REFERENCE` | Recorded machine-readable experiment results. These are the reference baselines - do not re-measure or edit them. |
| [`profiles/2026-10-12/`](profiles/2026-10-12/) | `REFERENCE` | The recorded routing/profile run for 2026-10-12. |
| [`../research/gpu-weather-texture/`](../research/gpu-weather-texture/) | `EXPERIMENT` | Archived experiment: pre-computing each forecast hour's U/V bands as GPU textures so a time change becomes a texture lookup. Never merged, never imported by the application, and unmeasured. It is prior art for ADR-001 D4 (resident time windows). |
| [`source/`](source/) | `REFERENCE` | The Sphinx source for the published user documentation, separate from this index. |
